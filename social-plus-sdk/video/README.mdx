social.plus video SDK allows engineers to integrate live-streaming capabilities into their applications. The live stream SDK simplifies mobile app development for iOS and Android by offering a common, cross-platform API to capture, encode, and stream live video and audio, without the hassle of deploying and maintaining your infrastructure.

social.plus video SDK allows you to:

* Implement and enable professional low-latency live streaming capabilities of up to four hours
* Provision a playback video when streaming ends
* Support high-volume concurrent viewers simultaneously
* Receive notifications when a live stream has started
* Manage and run multiple live streams in parallel
* Manage & moderate live streams via our admin panel
* Work across platforms, with SDKs available for both Android and iOS devices

More information on the implementation of these SDKâ€™s can be found under each of the following sections, for the respective platform (iOS, Android, Web).
