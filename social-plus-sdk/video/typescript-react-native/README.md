# TypeScript (Beta)

## Browser Support

* **Chrome**: 38+
* **Firefox**: 42+
* **Microsoft Edge**: 13+
* **Safari**: 9+
* **Opera**: 25+

{% hint style="danger" %}
Social Plus Web SDK probably won't work great in Internet Explorer 11. We generally support the recent versions of major browsers listed above.
{% endhint %}

Since Social Plus Web SDK uses local cache for performance and user experience reasons, server-side rendering is not supported. To use Social Plus Web SDK with NextJS, Social Plus Web SDK must be imported using [Dynamic Import with SSR disabled](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr).

#### React Native

For details on using the TypeScript SDK with **React Native**, refer to these [installation notes](../../../getting-started/installation-and-authentication/install-ts-reactnative-sdk.md#react-native-framework).

More than ever, videos are increasingly dominating mobile screens. From fun short-form clips to promote new products to live-streamed talk shows to educate your customers, videos have the potential to transform the way customers experience your brand.
