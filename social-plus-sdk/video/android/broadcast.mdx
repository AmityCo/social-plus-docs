# Broadcast Live Stream

To broadcast a live stream video, we provide a convenient broadcaster tool called `AmityStreamBroadcaster`.  We now only support 16:9 video ratio with the following resolution representing by the enum `AmityStreamBroadcastResolution`:

* `.SD_480P` indicates a video with resolution 480x854  and video bitrate 1216 kpbs
* `.HD_720P` indicates a video with resolution 720x1280  and video bitrate 2496 kpbs
* `.FHD_1080P` indicates a video with resolution 1080x1920  and video bitrate 4992 kpbs

#### Setup&#x20;

You simply need to include this dependency to your project in `build.gradle` in the application level.

```
 implementation 'com.github.AmityCo.Amity-Social-Cloud-SDK-Android:amity-video-publisher:x.y.z'
```

Inside your Application class, in the application initialization process, you need to register the video publisher SDK to the core SDK by calling.

```kotlin
  @Override
  open fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        AmityStreamBroadcasterClient.setup(AmityCoreClient.getConfiguration())
    }
```

&#x20;We highly recommend using Android's ConstraintLayout to construct our `AmityCameraView` Since we only support 16:9 video ratio, ConstratntLayout will ensure that the view will be drawn in the correct width and height.

### Authorize the required permissions

`AmityStreamBroadcaster` requires the following permissions to work properly.

As per the required parameter by the aforementioned object to provide `AmityCameraView` , you will need to define the view in your Activity or Fragment layout by :

1. Camera access
2. Microphone access

Before using `AmityStreamBroadcaster`, please make sure these permissions are granted.

See [here](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) the steps to ask for the permissions.

### **Create an AmityStreamBroadCaster Object**

In order to create the object, we also provide the `AmityStreamBroadCaster.Builder` class to create and configure this object easily. It requires `AmityCameraView` as a parameter and  `AmityStreamBroadcasterConfig` as a configurable value which will be explained in the following section.

```kotlin
val broadcaster = AmityStreamBroadcaster.Builder(amity_camera)
        .setConfiguration(configuration)
        .build()
```

#### Prepare a configuration

For configuration, we provide the `AmityStreamBroadcasterConfiguration.Builder` to construct the configuration conveniently. As we have mentioned above, We support `SD_480P`, `HD_720P` and, `FHD_1080P` resolutions. Orientations are relying on Android Configuration class, you may either choose Configuration.ORIENTATION\_PORTRAIT or `Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE` .

```kotlin
val configuration = AmityStreamBroadcasterConfiguration.Builder()
        .setOrientation(Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)
        .setResolution(AmityBroadcastResolution.HD_720P)
        .build()
```

#### Setup a layout

As per the required parameter by the aforementioned object to provide `AmityCameraView` , you need to define the view in your Activity or Fragment layout by :

```kotlin
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.amity.socialcloud.sdk.video.AmityCameraView
        android:id="@+id/amity_camera"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintDimensionRatio="H,9:16"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintVertical_bias="0.5">
    </com.amity.socialcloud.sdk.video.AmityCameraView>

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

We highly recommend using Android's ConstraintLayout to construct our `AmityCameraView` Since we only support 16:9 video ratio, ConstraintLayout ensures that the view will be drawn in the correct width and height.

#### Setup a layout in Jetpack Compose

In Jetpack Compose, inflate `AmityCameraView` as AndroidView and provide it to aforementioned object as below


### Preview the video

To begin previewing the camera input call

```swift
broadcaster.startPreview()
```

### Start live stream session

To begin broadcasting live stream call

```swift
broadcaster.startPublish(title: String, description: String)
```

### Stop live stream session

To stop broadcasting live stream call

```swift
broadcaster.stopPublish()
```

### Switch camera position

By default, the broadcaster will use the back camera. However, you can switch camera positions anytime by calling.

```swift
broadcaster.switchCamera()

```

### **Observe a broadcasting state**

To observe the status of a broadcast, we provide a function (flow) to observe any status changes and return as `AmityStreamBroadcasterState` . The possible statuses are :&#x20;

* `.IDLE`indicates a status of stream in an idle state.
* `.CONNECTING`indicates a status of stream that it's connecting to a rtmp server.
* `.CONNECTED`indicates a status of stream that it's connected to a rtmp server.
* `.DISNNECTED`indicates a status of stream that it's disconnected to a rtmp server. We also provide error information through an exception.

```swift
broadcaster.stateFlowable
        .subscribe { status ->
                when (status) {
                is AmitytreamBroadcasterState.CONNECTED { showConnected() }
                is AmitytreamBroadcasterState.CONNECTING { showConnecting() }
                is AmitytreamBroadcasterState.DISCONNECTED { showDisconnected()}
                }
 }
```
