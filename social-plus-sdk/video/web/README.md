{% hint style="danger" %}
Social Plus Web SDK probably won't work great in Internet Explorer 11. We generally support the recent versions of major browsers listed above.
{% endhint %}

Since Social Plus Web SDK uses a local cache for performance and user experience reasons, server-side rendering is not supported. To use Social Plus Web SDK with NextJS, Social Plus Web SDK must be imported using [Dynamic Import with SSR disabled](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr).
