## API

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a large number of users in bulk on Social Plus?">
    To create a large number of users, it's advised to use the following endpoint: [Register a session](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Session/post_api_v4_sessions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I use as the 'Authorization' token when I need to perform admin actions?">
    To obtain your admin token, please follow these steps on the [Social Plus console](https://console.social.plus/login?redirect=%2F&region=sg):

    1. Navigate to "Settings" > "Admin Users"
    2. Click on the cogwheel icon.

    <img src="../images/admin-token-setup.png" alt="Admin token setup" />

    This will provide you with the necessary 'Bearer' token to use for authorization when performing admin actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I retrieve the next page of data from an API?">
    To retrieve the next page of data from an API, you should use the "next" page token provided at the end of the initial page's results. This token should be appended to the endpoint to fetch the values for the next page.

    **Here's an example:**

    ```json
    {
      "paging": {
        "next": "eyJza2lwIjoyMCwibGltaXQiOjEwfQ=="
      }
    }
    ```

    To get the next page of data, append the "next" token to the endpoint like this:

    ```bash
    curl --location --globoff 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/communities?filter=all&sortBy=lastCreated&options[token]=eyJza2lwIjoxMCwibGltaXQiOjEwfQ%3D%3D' \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I upload a bulk list of blocklisted words?">
    You can upload a bulk list of blocklisted words using an example like this:

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/blacklist/records' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx' \
    --data '{
      "regexs": [
        "word1",
        "word2", 
        "word3"
      ],
      "isMatchExactWord": true
    }'
    ```

    <Warning>
    Setting `isMatchExactWord` to `true` makes the blocklisting more strict and will only block exact matches, while setting it to `false` makes the blocklisting more permissive and will block any occurrence of the blocklisted word within a larger text.
    </Warning>

    **API:** [Blocklist Records](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Moderation/post_api_v3_blocklists)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I modify my follow/unfollow settings?">
    You can adjust your follow/unfollow settings by making an API call to the network settings endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/network-settings/social' \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx' \
    --data '{
      "isFollowWithRequestEnabled": false
    }'
    ```

    **API:** [Network Settings](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Network%20Setting/put_api_v3_network_settings_social)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I obtain higher-quality images?">
    For higher-quality images, you can enhance the resolution by simply adding `?size=full` to the end of the URL.

    **Example:** `https://api.amity.co/api/v3/files/{fileId}/download?size=full`

    <Tip>
    You have the flexibility to specify the size as "small," "medium," "large," or "full" based on your preferences.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a refreshToken?">
    A refreshToken is primarily employed by SDKs to validate the accessToken's validity. When using the API, obtaining a new token can be achieved by making a "register session" API call, eliminating the need to directly manage or use a refreshToken.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does the authentication token last?">
    The authentication token has a duration of 10 minutes, and it must be used within that specific time frame. 
    
    For further information on secure mode and authentication tokens, please refer to: [Secure Mode Documentation](https://docs.amity.co/analytics-and-moderation/console/settings/security#secure-mode)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I retrieve a list of communities I have joined using API?">
    To list the communities you've joined, use this API with the filter set to 'member':

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/communities?filter=member&sortBy=lastCreated&options%5Blimit%5D=100' \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx'
    ```

    **API:** [Get Communities](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Community/get_api_v3_communities)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I obtain a new access token once the authentication token has expired?">
    You will have to get a new authentication token after the expiration of the current one:

    **Step 1: Get Authentication Token**
    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/authentication/token?userId=Amity' \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'x-server-key: xxx'
    ```

    **Step 2: Register Session with New Token**
    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v4/sessions' \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: xxx' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "userId": "Amity",
      "deviceId": "test", 
      "authToken": "xxx"
    }'
    ```

    **APIs:** 
    - [Authentication Token](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Authentication/get_api_v3_authentication_token)
    - [Register Session](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Session/post_api_v4_sessions)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Social and Chat

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the purpose of targetType and targetId?">
    The targetType and targetId parameters are essential in query options for fetching posts from a specific feed.

    - **targetType** specifies the type of feed, which can be either 'user' or 'community'
    - **targetId** is the identifier for the specific feed, such as a userId for a user feed or a communityId for a community feed

    For a comprehensive explanation, refer to: [Query Posts Documentation](https://docs.amity.co/amity-sdk/social/posts/query-post)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it possible to sort posts within a community by engagement?">
    Currently, posts within a community can't be sorted by engagement like the global feed. The available sorting options for community posts are:
    - `lastCreated` 
    - `firstCreated`

    For more information: [Query Posts Documentation](https://docs.amity.co/amity-sdk/social/posts/query-post)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I query communities while excluding deleted ones?">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="API">
        Include the parameter `isDeleted: false` in your request:

        ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v3/communities?filter=all&isDeleted=false' \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx'
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="SDK">
        Set the `includeDelete: false` parameter when using the SDK:

        ```javascript
        // Example with SDK
        const communities = await queryCommunities({
          includeDelete: false
        });
        ```

        For more details: [Query Communities SDK](https://docs.amity.co/amity-sdk/social/communities/query-communities)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does querying a list of objects only return 20 items?">
    This behavior is due to pagination implemented in our API endpoints and functions, which default to returning 20 items per page. 

    To access more items, you need to use:
    - **API**: The `next page token` (refer to pagination section above)
    - **SDK**: The `nextPage()` function

    For detailed information on pagination: [Live Objects/Collections](https://docs.amity.co/amity-sdk/core-concepts/live-objects-collections)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I update a community user's role?">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="API">
        ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.sg.amity.co/api/v4/communities/657306a3189cef362ea99923/users/roles' \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxx' \
        --data '{
          "roles": ["community-moderator"],
          "userIds": ["test"]
        }'
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Console">
        For Admin Users using the Console:
        1. Go to the specific community
        2. Navigate to the 'Members' tab
        3. Locate the user whose role you want to change
        4. Click on the three dots button
        5. Select 'Change user role'
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    **API:** [Add Roles to Community Users](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Community/post_api_v4_communities__communityId__users_roles)

## Frequent Error Types: Definition

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Why am I encountering "Error: Connect client first"?'>
    This error occurs when an SDK function is called before successfully establishing a connection to the Social Plus session.

    **Solution:** Ensure you call UserRepository functions only after the session state is set to 'established':

    ```javascript
    const [sessionState, setSessionState] = useState('');

    useEffect(() => {
      return Client.onSessionStateChange((state) => {
        setSessionState(state);
      });
    }, []);

    // Only call SDK functions when sessionState === 'established'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='What does "Query Token is invalid" mean?'>
    This error indicates a problem with the pagination token. Use the pagination token from the previous response:

    ```json
    "paging": {
        "next": "string",
        "previous": "string"
    }
    ```

    Use the value from the 'next' or 'previous' string as your query token to access additional pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='What does "Unable to use SDK while the SDK is logging in" mean?'>
    This error occurs when other actions are attempted while the SDK login process is in progress.

    **Solution:** Ensure other actions are initiated only after the login process has successfully completed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='What does "RateLimit Exceed" mean?'>
    Our API/function has a rate limit of **100 calls per user within a 5-second window**.

    **Solution:** Monitor and control the number of calls to ensure they don't exceed this limit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do when encountering error code 400314 with image posts?">
    Error code 400314 is related to image moderation settings.

    **Steps to resolve:**
    1. Check if image moderation is enabled in console settings
    2. Go to Settings > Image Moderation tab
    3. Adjust the confidence level appropriately

    <Warning>
    Don't set the confidence level too low, as it may block all images.
    </Warning>

    **Documentation:** [Image Moderation Settings](https://docs.amity.co/analytics-and-moderation/console/settings/image-moderation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I unable to post links and receiving error 400309?">
    This error occurs due to link moderation. Links not in the allow list cannot be posted.

    **Solution:** 
    1. Go to console "Moderation" > "Allow list" tab
    2. Add permitted links to the allow list
    3. Or disable link moderation if appropriate
  </Accordion>
