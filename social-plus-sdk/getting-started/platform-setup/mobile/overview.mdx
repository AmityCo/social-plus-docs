## Mobile Development Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data and resources on-demand
- **Image Caching**: Implement efficient image loading and caching
- **Network Efficiency**: Batch requests and use compression
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources and subscriptions

### User Experience
- **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when network is unavailable
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
- **Push Notifications**: Timely and relevant notifications

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection**: Never embed API keys in mobile apps
- **Certificate Pinning**: Secure network communications
- **Local Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data stored locally
- **Authentication**: Implement secure token-based authentication

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test SDK integration and business logic
- **UI Tests**: Automated testing of user interactions
- **Network Tests**: Mock network conditions and responses
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor memory usage and response times

### Device Testing
- **Physical Devices**: Test on real devices for accurate performance
- **Different OS Versions**: Ensure compatibility across versions
- **Various Screen Sizes**: Test responsive layouts and interactions
- **Network Conditions**: Test on different connection speeds

## Deployment Considerations

### iOS Deployment
- **App Store Guidelines**: Follow Apple's review guidelines
- **Provisioning Profiles**: Proper signing and certificates
- **Background Modes**: Configure required background capabilities
- **Privacy Permissions**: Request appropriate user permissions

### Android Deployment
- **Play Store Policies**: Comply with Google Play policies
- **App Signing**: Use Play App Signing for security
- **Permissions**: Request minimal required permissions
- **Proguard/R8**: Configure code obfuscation properly
