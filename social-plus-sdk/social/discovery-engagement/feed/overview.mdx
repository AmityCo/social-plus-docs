Social Plus SDK provides a powerful Feed feature that allows users to stay informed, communicate, and express themselves through ranked posts. The Feed system creates an engaging timeline experience with intelligent content curation and multiple feed types to suit different user needs.

The Feed feature is comprised of a collection of posts, with three distinct types of feeds available to users: User Feed, Community Feed, and Global Feed. By providing these distinct feed types, the SDK enables users to customize their content experience, ensuring they receive relevant and engaging content that reflects their interests and preferences.

## Feed Types

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="User Feed" icon="user">
    A collection of posts curated for an individual user's timeline, providing content they generate.
  </Card>

</AccordionGroup>

## Ranking Systems

Social Plus SDK offers two distinct ranking mechanisms for Global Feed to provide flexible content curation options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Chronological Ranking" icon="clock">
    **Traditional Time-Based Sorting**
    - Posts ordered by creation time
    - Newer posts appear first
    - Simple, predictable ordering
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom Post Ranking" icon="trophy">
    **Smart Engagement-Based Sorting**
    - Advanced scoring algorithm
    - Factors in engagement, timing, and updates
    - Promotes meaningful interactions
    - Optimized for content discovery
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Custom Post Ranking

<Info>
**Enhanced Content Discovery**: Our custom post ranking algorithm uses a smarter ranking system that supports a score-sorting mechanism, focusing on "meaningful interactions" to surface the most relevant and engaging content.
</Info>

### How Custom Ranking Works

The custom post ranking algorithm considers multiple factors to determine post visibility and ordering:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engagement Rate" icon="heart">
    **Primary Ranking Factor**
    - Posts with more comments and reactions rank higher
    - Comments score twice as much as reactions
    - High engagement rate has significant impact on ranking
    - Promotes content that generates meaningful interactions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time of Posting" icon="clock">
    **Temporal Relevance**
    - Newer posts naturally rank higher than older posts
    - Time decay is applied where scores decrease as posts age
    - Balances freshness with engagement
    - Ensures recent content remains visible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Updates" icon="pencil">
    **Update Boost Mechanism**
    - Post updates and edits provide score boosts
    - New comments and reactions count as updates
    - Keeps evolving conversations visible
    - Rewards active content modification
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>


### Current Limitations

<Warning>
**Important Considerations**: Please be aware of these current limitations with custom post ranking:
</Warning>

1. **Global Feed Delay**: While newly created posts appear immediately in User Feed, there may be a momentary delay before they appear in Global Feed due to ranking calculations.

2. **Ranking Formula Updates**: Currently cannot be updated via Admin Console - requires Social Plus Support contact for formula validation and implementation.

3. **Post Visibility Limit**: Only up to 20 posts from each user or community that you follow are visible in the global feed.

## Implementation

### Conventional Global Feed Query

<Info>
**Simple Chronological Ordering**: The conventional method returns posts in chronological order, providing a straightforward way to view the most recent content.
</Info>

The system does not guarantee the visibility of older posts â€” only the 20 most recent posts in a community are visible in the global feed.

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
var token: AmityNotificationToken?

func getCommunityFeedExample() {
    let feedCollection = feedRepository.getGlobalFeed()
    token = feedCollection.observe { collection, change, error in
        // React to changes here
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryGlobalFeed(feedRepository: AmityFeedRepository) {
    feedRepository
        .getGlobalFeed()
        .build()
        .getPagingData()
        .doOnNext { pagingData: PagingData<AmityPost> ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
const { FeedRepository } = await import('@amityco/ts-sdk');

async function queryGlobalFeed() {
  const { data: posts } = await FeedRepository.queryGlobalFeed();

  return posts;
}
```

```dart Flutter
  final amityPosts = <AmityPost>[];
  late PagingController<AmityPost> _controller;

  void initPagingController() {
    //inititate the PagingController
    _controller = PagingController(
      pageFuture: (token) => AmitySocialClient.newFeedRepository()
          .getGlobalFeed()
          .getPagingData(token: token, limit: 20),
      pageSize: 20,
    )..addListener(
        () {
          if (_controller.error == null) {
            //handle results, we suggest to clear the previous items
            //and add with the latest _controller.loadedItems
            amityPosts.clear();
            amityPosts.addAll(_controller.loadedItems);
            //update widgets
          } else {
            //error on pagination controller
            //update widgets
          }
        },
      );
  }

//when the ListView widget is reached the bottom of the
//page, you need to trigger next page by calling
//_controller.fetchNextPage()
  void loadMore() {
    _controller.fetchNextPage()
        //optional
        .then((value) {
      //success
    });
  }
```
</CodeGroup>

### Custom Post Ranking Query

<Info>
**Smart Content Curation**: Custom post ranking provides a smarter global feed that supports score-sorting mechanism, ensuring posts are presented in order of relevance with the most engaging content at the top.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
var token: AmityNotificationToken?

func getCommunityFeedExample() {
    let feedCollection = feedRepository.getCustomRankingGlobalFeed()
    token = feedCollection.observe { collection, change, error in
        // React to changes here
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryCustomRankingFeed(feedRepository: AmityFeedRepository) {
    feedRepository
        .getCustomRankingGlobalFeed()
        .build()
        .getPagingData()
        .doOnNext { pagingData: PagingData<AmityPost> ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
const { FeedRepository } = await import('@amityco/ts-sdk');

async function queryCustomRankingFeed() {
  const { data: posts } = await FeedRepository.queryGlobalFeed({ useCustomRanking: true });

  return posts;
}
```

```dart Flutter
  final amityPosts = <AmityPost>[];
  late PagingController<AmityPost> _controller;

  void initPagingController() {
    //inititate the PagingController
    _controller = PagingController(
      pageFuture: (token) => AmitySocialClient.newFeedRepository()
          .getCustomRankingGlobalFeed()
          .getPagingData(token: token, limit: 20),
      pageSize: 20,
    )..addListener(
        () {
          if (_controller.error == null) {
            //handle results, we suggest to clear the previous items
            //and add with the latest _controller.loadedItems
            amityPosts.clear();
            amityPosts.addAll(_controller.loadedItems);
            //update widgets
          } else {
            //error on pagination controller
            //update widgets
          }
        },
      );
  }

//when the ListView widget is reached the bottom of the
//page, you need to trigger next page by calling
//_controller.fetchNextPage()
  void loadMore() {
    _controller
        .fetchNextPage()
        //optional
        .then((value) {
      //success
    });
  }
  ```
