## Grouping Logic

### Event Aggregation

Notifications are grouped based on specific criteria to provide a better user experience:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Post Grouping" icon="layer-group">
    **Rule**: Post events in the same community within the same day are grouped together.
    
    **Supported For**: Only `post` events
    
    **Examples**:
    - Multiple users posting in the same community on the same day
    
    **Message Format**:
    - **2 actors**: ``displayName_1`` and ``displayName_2`` posted in ``communityDisplayName``
    - **3+ actors**: ``displayName_1`` and ``number`` others posted in ``communityDisplayName``
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Individual Events" icon="user">
    **Rule**: All other events remain as individual notifications.
    
    **Supported For**: `poll`, `comment`, `reply`, `reaction`, `mention`, `follow`
    
    **Examples**:
    - A single user mentioning you in a post
    - A single reaction to your content
    - A single comment on your post
    - A single user following you
    
    **Message Format**:
    - Standard individual event message templates as specified above
