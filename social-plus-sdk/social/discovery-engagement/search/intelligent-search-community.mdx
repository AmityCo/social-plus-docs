```swift iOS
// Search Options
let options = AmityCommunitySemanticSearchOptions(query: "shoes", categoryIds: nil, tags: nil, communityMembershipStatus: .all)

token = communityRepository.semanticSearchCommunities(options: options).observe({ liveCollection, _, error in
    
    let allCommunities = liveCollection.snapshots
    // ...
})
```

```kotlin Android

    communityRepository.semanticSearchCommunities(
        query = "fun",
        filter = AmityCommunityMembershipStatusFilter.ALL, // ALL | MEMBER | NOT_MEMBER
        tags =  AmityTags(listOf("tag1", "tag2")),
        categoryIds = listOf("category1", "category2")
    ).doOnNext { pagingData: PagingData<AmityCommunity> ->
        // PagingData<AmityCommunity>
    }.doOnError {
        // Exception
    }.subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

// Variables to handle pagination
let nextPageFn: (() => void) | undefined; // Function to load the next page of data
let hasMore: boolean | undefined; // Boolean flag indicating if more pages are available

const unsubscriber = CommunityRepository.semanticSearchCommunities(
  {
    query: 'game',
    communityMembershipStatus: CommunityRepository.AmityCommunityMemberStatusFilter.ALL,
  },
  ({ data: communities, onNextPage, hasNextPage, loading, error }) => {
    if (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
    }
    if (loading) {
      // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
    }
    if (communities) {
      // Process the data
    }
    hasMore = hasNextPage; // Update the hasMore flag
    nextPageFn = onNextPage; // Update the nextPage function with the new one provided
  },
);

// Function to load more items (next page)
function loadMore() {
  // Check if more pages are available to load
  if (hasMore) {
    nextPageFn?.(); // Execute the nextPage function if it's defined
  }
}

### Practical Search Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New User Onboarding">

    - Increases community discovery and engagement
    - Provides personalized recommendations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Organization">
    **Scenario**: User wants to find specific communities they're already in
    
    **Approach**: Use `membershipFilter: MEMBER` with specific search terms
    
    **Benefits**:
    - Quick access to joined communities
    - Efficient community management
    - Improved user experience
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Category-Specific Discovery">
    **Scenario**: User interested in specific topics within a category
    
    **Approach**: Combine `categoryIds` filtering with semantic search
    
    **Benefits**:
    - Focused, relevant results
    - Reduced noise in search results
    - Better match with user intent
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations & Considerations

<Warning>
**Current Limitations:**

- **Search Scope**: Limited to community names and descriptions only
- **Content Exclusion**: Does not search within community posts or comments
- **Language Mixing**: Mixed-language queries may have reduced accuracy
- **Real-time Lag**: New communities may take a few moments to appear in search results
</Warning>
