## Scoring Algorithm

Our intelligent search uses a sophisticated hybrid scoring system that combines multiple factors to deliver the most relevant results.

### Score Composition

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lexical Score (30%)" icon="text">
    Traditional keyword matching that identifies exact or similar text matches in content, titles, and descriptions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Semantic Score (70%)" icon="brain">
    AI-powered understanding of meaning and context, enabling discovery of relevant content even without exact keyword matches.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Score Range & Interpretation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Score Range: 0.9 - 1.0 (Excellent Match)">
    **Characteristics:**
    - Perfect semantic alignment with search intent
    - High lexical similarity
    - Ideal for strict relevance requirements
    
    **Example:** Searching "red fruits" returns "strawberry recipes" and "cherry cultivation"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Score Range: 0.7 - 0.8 (Very Good Match)">
    **Characteristics:**
    - Strong semantic relevance
    - Good lexical matches
    - Recommended for most use cases
    
    **Example:** Searching "red fruits" returns "apple varieties" and "raspberry farming"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Score Range: 0.5 - 0.6 (Good Match)">
    **Characteristics:**
    - Moderate relevance
    - Some contextual connection
    - Useful for broader discovery
    
    **Example:** Searching "red fruits" returns "healthy snacks" and "fruit nutrition"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Score Range: 0.0 - 0.4 (Low Match)">
    **Characteristics:**
    - Weak relevance
    - Tangential connections
    - May include unrelated content
    
    **Example:** Searching "red fruits" might return "colorful vegetables" or "fruit trees"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Network-Level Configuration

<Info>
Advanced filtering and scoring parameters can be configured at the network level through the [Network Settings API](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Network%20Setting/put_api_v3_network_settings_semantic_search). This requires admin permissions.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Broad vs. Focused Search

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low Threshold (0.3)">
    **Query:** "Red Fruits"
    
    **Results Include:**
    - üçé Apples (direct match)
    - üçì Strawberries (direct match)  
    - üçå Bananas (loosely related - fruit category)
    - ü•ï Carrots (color match)
    - üçï Tomato recipes (red color, fruit technically)
    
    **Use Case:** Content discovery, exploring related topics
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="High Threshold (0.8)">
    **Query:** "Red Fruits"
    
    **Results Include:**
    - üçí Cherries (perfect match)
    - üçì Strawberries (perfect match)
    - üçé Red apples (perfect match)

    **Use Case:** Precise searches, specific information needs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Current Limitations

<Warning>
**Known Constraints:**

- **User Activity**: Recent user behavior and preferences are not factored into result ranking
- **Real-time Suggestions**: Type-ahead search suggestions are not available across all API endpoints
- **Content Freshness**: Results prioritize relevance over recency (can be configured)
- **Multilingual Queries**: Mixed-language queries may have reduced accuracy
</Warning>
