# Get Community

Users can retrieve information about the community, such as the community name, description, and member count, without actually becoming a member of the community. This provides a way for users to explore their community options and find the communities that are most relevant and engaging to them.

To fetch a community's data without joining, users can simply call the `getCommunity` method within the SDK and provide the relevant parameter, such as the community ID. The retrieved result is returned as a live object of a post. For more information on live objects, please refer to [live-objects-collections](../../core-concepts/live-objects-collections/ "mention").
