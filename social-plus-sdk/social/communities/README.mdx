## Overview

Communities are the heart of social engagement, providing dedicated spaces where users can connect, share content, and build relationships around shared interests. The social.plus SDK offers comprehensive community management features including creation, moderation, membership management, and content control.

<Info>
Communities support both public and private visibility, with granular post settings and moderation controls to maintain healthy engagement.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Community Types

Choose the right visibility level for your community needs:

### Public Communities
- **Visibility**: Open to all users
- **Discovery**: Searchable and discoverable
- **Joining**: Anyone can join without approval
- **Content**: Visible to all community members

### Private Communities  
- **Visibility**: Only visible to creator and invited members
- **Discovery**: Not searchable by non-members
- **Joining**: Invitation-only access
- **Content**: Restricted to community members

## Post Settings

Control how content is shared and moderated within your communities:

| Setting | Description | Moderation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `anyoneCanPost` | All members can post immediately | No review required |
| `adminReviewPostRequired` | Posts require moderator approval | Admin review before publication |
| `onlyAdminCanPost` | Only moderators can create posts | Admin-only content creation |

<Warning>
The default setting is `anyoneCanPost`. Consider using moderation for sensitive or professional communities.
</Warning>
