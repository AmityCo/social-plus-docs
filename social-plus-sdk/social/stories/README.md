Stories, unlike traditional posts, excel in sharing time-sensitive updates like promotions or event highlights. With SP Stories, you're not just sharing content - you're crafting an experience. Imagine effortlessly sharing quick tips or behind-the-scenes glimpses. SP Stories is your platform to capture moments that matter, working in synergy alongside our existing posts and videos feature - further complementing your content strategy in driving user engagement.

Our SDK provides tools for creating, viewing, and interacting with diverse story contentâ€”images, videos, and links; as well as configurable story duration and expiry periods. Additionally, you can also collect valuable insights regarding story interactions for analytics and reporting purposes, such as views, reach (unique views), reactions, and Click-Through Rates (CTR). This data will also be made available on our Dashboard soon.

Stories can currently only be created in community feeds, by users with story creation permissions ("MANAGE_COMMUNITY_STORY"). By default, these permissions are automatically assigned to the following roles: moderator, community moderator, super-moderator, and global admin. If you have non-moderators whom you'd like to be able to contribute to the community's story feed, you can assign these permissions to your users. Read more [here](https://docs.amity.co/amity-sdk/core-concepts/user/user-permission#permissions).

Creating, viewing, and deleting stories is also [available](https://docs.amity.co/analytics-and-moderation/console/stories) on SP Console.

### Story Structure

A Story is multi-layered. The primary content, "**Data**," depending on the dataType, can be either an IMAGE or a VIDEO. The secondary content, "**StoryItems**," complements the main content, serving as additional components. For instance, the first supported StoryItem is a Hyperlink, containing URL information and its alias. Overlaying the main content allows users to click and be redirected to the predefined destination.

### Story Repository

The functionality of stories can be utilized through the `StoryRepository`, which offers methods for interacting with a data source that stores stories. This includes methods for obtaining stories, creating a new story, and deleting a story.
