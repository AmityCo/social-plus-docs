social.plus Member Management provides administrators and moderators with direct control over community membership. This administrative approach allows bypassing normal join workflows to efficiently manage member onboarding, staff additions, member cleanup, and enforcement actions.

<Info>
Member management functions require appropriate moderator permissions. Adding members to private communities automatically grants them access to community content, while removing members revokes all community privileges.

## Administrative vs User-Initiated Actions

Understanding the difference between administrative member management and user-initiated actions:

| Action Type | Who Initiates | Use Cases | Approval Required |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Administrative Add** | Moderators/Admins | Staff onboarding, VIP access, bulk imports | No - Direct addition |
| **User Join** | Users themselves | Organic growth, self-service joining | Depends on community settings |
| **Administrative Remove** | Moderators/Admins | Policy violations, cleanup, role changes | No - Immediate removal |
| **User Leave** | Users themselves | Voluntary departure, account management | No - Immediate departure |

## Add Members

The `addMembers()` function allows administrators and moderators to directly add users to a community, bypassing normal join workflows. This is ideal for invitation-only communities, adding staff members, or bulk member management.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `userIds` | String[] | Yes | Array of user IDs to add as community members |
| `communityId` | String | Yes | ID of the target community |


<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
do {
    let isAdded = try await communityMembership.addMembers(["user1", "user2"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun addMembers(
    communityRepository: AmityCommunityRepository
) {
    val addingUserIds = listOf("user1", "user2")
    communityRepository.membership(communityId = "communityId")
        .addMembers(userIds = addingUserIds)
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // AmityException
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function addMembers(communityId: Amity.Community['communityId'],
  userIds: [Amity.User['userId']]): Promise<Boolean> {

  const isAdded = await CommunityRepository.Membership.addMembers(communityId, userIds);

  return isAdded;
}
```

```dart Flutter
late PagingController<AmityCommunityMember> _controller;

void addMembers(String communityId) {
  AmitySocialClient.newCommunityRepository()
      .membership(communityId)
      .addMembers(['userId1', 'userId2'])
      .then((members) => {
            //handle result
            //optional: to present the added communityMember in to the current communityMember collection
            //you will need manually put the newly added communityMember in to the collection
            //for example :
            _controller.addAll(members)
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Remove Members

The `removeMembers()` function allows administrators and moderators to remove users from a community. This action immediately revokes all community privileges and access, useful for enforcing community rules or removing inactive members.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `userIds` | String[] | Yes | Array of user IDs to remove from the community |
| `communityId` | String | Yes | ID of the target community |

<Warning>
Removing members is immediate and permanent until they are re-added or rejoin. Consider using warnings or temporary restrictions before removing members entirely.
</Warning>

### Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
// Remove members from community
func removeMembersFromCommunity(
    communityId: String,
    userIds: [String]
) {
  do {
    let isRemoved = try await communityMembership.removeMembers(["user1", "user2"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun removeMembers(
    communityRepository: AmityCommunityRepository
) {
    val removingUserIds = listOf("user1", "user2")
    communityRepository.membership(communityId = "communityId")
        .removeMembers(userIds = removingUserIds)
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // AmityException
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function removeMembers(communityId: Amity.Community['communityId'],
  userIds: [Amity.User['userId']]): Promise<Boolean> {
    
  const isRemoved = await CommunityRepository.Membership.removeMembers(communityId, userIds);

  return isRemoved;
}
```

```dart Flutter
late PagingController<AmityCommunityMember> _controller;

void removeMembers(String communityId, List<String> removingMemberIds) {
  AmitySocialClient.newCommunityRepository()
      .membership(communityId)
      .removeMembers(removingMemberIds)
      .then((value) => {
            //handle result
            //success
            //optional: to remove the removed communityMember from the current communityMember collection
            //you will need manually remove the removed communityMember from the collection
            //for example :
            _controller.removeWhere(
                (element) => removingMemberIds.contains(element.userId))
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```
