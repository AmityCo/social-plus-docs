## Trending Communities

The `getTrendingCommunities()` method identifies communities with high levels of member activity and engagement, regardless of the current user's membership status. This feature is perfect for showcasing popular communities and driving discovery of active community spaces.

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
var token: AmityNotificationToken?

func queryCommunitiesExample() {
    token = communityRepository.getTrendingCommunities().observe { collection, change, error in
        for community in collection.allObjects() {
            // For example, to handle each community in the list.
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryTrendingCommunity(communityRepository: AmityCommunityRepository) {
    communityRepository
        .getTrendingCommunities()
        .doOnNext { communityList: List<AmityCommunity> ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

//Trending communities can return only up to 15 communities
const unsubscriber = CommunityRepository.getTrendingCommunities(
  {limit: 5},
  ({ data: communities, loading, error }) => {
    if (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
    }
    if (loading) {
      // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
    }
    if (communities) {
      // Process the data
    }
  },
);
```

```dart Flutter
void getTrendingCommunities() {
  AmitySocialClient.newCommunityRepository()
      .getTrendingCommunities()
      .then((List<AmityCommunity> trendingCommunites) => {
            //handle result
            //return maximum 5 trending communities
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```

## Recommended Communities

The `getRecommendedCommunities()` method provides personalized community suggestions specifically for communities the user has not yet joined. This algorithm focuses on relevance and user preferences to suggest communities that match user interests and behavior patterns.

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
var token: AmityNotificationToken?

func queryCommunitiesExample() {
    token = communityRepository.getRecommendedCommunities().observe { collection, change, error in
        for community in collection.allObjects() {
            // For example, to handle each community in the list.
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryRecommendedCommunity(communityRepository: AmityCommunityRepository) {
    communityRepository
        .getRecommendedCommunities()
        .doOnNext { communityList: List<AmityCommunity> ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

// Recommended communities can return only up to 15 communities
const unsubscriber = CommunityRepository.getRecommendedCommunities(
  { limit: 5, includeDiscoverablePrivateCommunity: true },
  ({ data: communities, loading, error }) => {
    if (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
    }
    if (loading) {
      // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
    }
    if (communities) {
      // Process the data
    }
  },
);
```

```dart Flutter
void getRecommendedCommunities() {
  AmitySocialClient.newCommunityRepository()
      .getRecommendedCommunities()
      .then((List<AmityCommunity> trendingCommunites) => {
            //handle result
            //return maximum 5 recommended communities
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Recommendation Refresh**: Update trending and recommended communities periodically to keep discovery content fresh, but avoid too frequent updates that might confuse users.
</Tip>

### User Experience Guidelines

1. **Loading States**: Show skeleton screens during discovery data fetching
2. **Empty States**: Provide fallback content when no recommendations are available
3. **Action Feedback**: Give immediate feedback when users join discovered communities

### Performance Optimization

1. **Pagination**: Implement lazy loading for large discovery feeds
2. **Image Optimization**: Preload community avatars for smooth scrolling
3. **Background Updates**: Refresh discovery data in the background
