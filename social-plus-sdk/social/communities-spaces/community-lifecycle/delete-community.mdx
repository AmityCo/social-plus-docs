social.plus SDK enables permanent community deletion for authorized users when communities are no longer needed. Community deletion removes all associated data including posts, comments, members, and metadata, making this an irreversible operation that requires careful implementation.

## Delete Community

The SDK provides a way for creators or moderators to delete a community by calling the `deleteCommunity` method. In the JavaScript SDK, this method is referred to as the `closeCommunity` method.

To delete a community using this method, users can call the method and provide the `communityId` as a parameter. This will trigger the deletion process, which will remove the community and associated community data.

<Warning>
It is important to note that deleting a community is a permanent action and cannot be undone. As such, it is recommended that users exercise caution when deciding to delete a community and ensure that they have taken all necessary precautions to preserve any important content or data associated with the community.
</Warning>

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `communityId` | String | Yes | Unique identifier of the community to delete |

### Permission Requirements

| Role | Delete Permission | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| **Community Creator** | Yes | Can delete their own communities |
| **Community Moderator** | Yes | Can delete communities they moderate |
| **Administrator** | Yes | Can delete any community with proper permissions |
| **Regular Member** | No | Cannot delete communities |

### Data Removal Impact

When a community is deleted, the following data is removed:

- **Community Profile**: Name, description, avatar, metadata
- **All Posts**: Text, images, videos, polls, and custom posts
- **All Comments**: Comments and replies on community posts
- **Member List**: All community memberships and join requests
- **Stories**: Community stories and their associated data
- **Settings**: Post moderation settings and story configurations

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
communityRepository.deleteCommunity(withId: "community-id") { success, error in
    // Handle the result.
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun deleteCommunity(communityRepository: AmityCommunityRepository) {
    communityRepository
        .deleteCommunity(communityId = "communityId")
        .doOnComplete {
            //success
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommunityRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function deleteCommunity(communityId: Amity.Community['communityId']): Promise<Amity.Community> {
  const community = await CommunityRepository.deleteCommunity(communityId);

  return community;
}
```

```dart Flutter
//current community collection
late PagingController<AmityCommunity> _controller;
void deleteCommunity(String communityId) {
  AmitySocialClient.newCommunityRepository()
      .deleteCommunity(communityId)
      .then((value) => {
            //success
            //optional: to remove the deleted community from the current community collection
            //you will need manually remove the deleted community from the collection
            //for example :
            _controller
                .removeWhere((element) => element.communityId == communityId)
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```

## Pre-Deletion Considerations

### Data Backup Strategies

Before implementing community deletion, consider these backup approaches:

1. **Export Community Data**: Allow admins to export posts and member lists
2. **Migration Options**: Migrate content to other communities
3. **Member Notification**: Notify members before deletion with backup options

### Member Management

Handle member relationships during deletion:

- **Active Members**: Automatically remove all memberships
- **Pending Requests**: Cancel all pending join requests

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Safety First**: Implement multiple confirmation steps and consider a "cooling off" period for community deletion requests to prevent impulsive decisions.
</Tip>

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Multi-Step Confirmation**: Require multiple explicit confirmations
2. **Name Verification**: Make users type the community name to confirm
3. **Permission Checks**: Verify user permissions before showing delete options
4. **Loading States**: Show clear progress during deletion operations
5. **Success Feedback**: Provide clear confirmation of successful deletion

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Clear Warnings**: Emphasize the permanent nature of deletion
2. **Data Export**: Offer data export before deletion
3. **Member Communication**: Provide tools to notify community members
4. **Navigation**: Handle post-deletion navigation appropriately
