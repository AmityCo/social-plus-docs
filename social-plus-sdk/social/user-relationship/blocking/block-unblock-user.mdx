Empower users to control their social experience by blocking or unblocking other users. Blocking is essential for user safety, privacy, and content control.

## Block User

<Blockquote>
Users can block other users to prevent unwanted interactions. This action is immediate and silent (no notification sent).
</Blockquote>

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
// Block a user by userId
 do {
    try await userRelationship.blockUser(userId: "user-id")
    print("User blocked successfully")
} catch let error {
    print("Unable to block user \(error)")
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun blockUser(
    userRepository: AmityUserRepository,
    userId: String
) {
    userRepository
        .relationship()
        .blockUser(userId = userId)
        .doOnComplete {
            //  success
        }
        .doOnError {
            //  handle exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function blockUser() {
  const { follows } = await UserRepository.Relationship.blockUser('userId');
  return follows;
}

async function blockUserThenGetFollowCount() {
  const { followCounts } = await UserRepository.Relationship.blockUser('userId');
  return followCounts;
}
```

```dart Flutter
void blockUser(String userId) {
  AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository().relationship().blockUser(userId).then((value) {
    //success
  }).onError((error, stackTrace) {
    //handle error
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Unblock User

<Blockquote>
Unblocking a user restores visibility and interaction, but the connection status always resets to `none`. Users must reconnect if they wish to follow again.
</Blockquote>

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
// Unblock a user by userId
do {
    try await userRelationship.unblockUser(userId: "user-id")
    print("User unblocked successfully")
} catch let error {
    print("Unable to unblock user \(error)")
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun unblockUser(
    userRepository: AmityUserRepository,
    userId: String
) {
    userRepository
        .relationship()
        .unblockUser(userId = userId)
        .doOnComplete {
            //  success
        }
        .doOnError {
            //  handle exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function unBlockUser() {
  const { follows } = await UserRepository.Relationship.unBlockUser('userId');
  return follows;
}

async function unBlockUserThenGetFollowCount() {
  const { followCounts } = await UserRepository.Relationship.unBlockUser('userId');
  return followCounts;
}
```

```dart Flutter
void unBlockUser(String userId) {
  AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository().relationship().unblockUser(userId).then((value) {
    //success
  }).onError((error, stackTrace) {
    //handle error
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Experience" icon="user-check">
    - Always provide confirmation dialogs for blocking/unblocking actions.
    - Clearly indicate blocked status in the UI.
    - Allow users to manage their blocked list easily.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy & Safety" icon="shield">
    - Never notify users when they are blocked.
    - Ensure all blocked user content and interactions are hidden.
    - Respect privacy and content visibility settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
