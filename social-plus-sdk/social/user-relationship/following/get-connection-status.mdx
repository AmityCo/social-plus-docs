## Get User Follow Information

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
let userRepository = AmityUserRepository(client: client)
let userRelationship = userRepository.userRelationship

// To get the current user to follow information, use getMyFollowInfo.
token = userRelationship.getMyFollowInfo().observe({ liveObject, error in
    // Handle result
})

// To get the other's user follow information, use getFollowInfo with the userId parameter.
token = userRelationship.getFollowInfo(withUserId: "user-id").observe({ liveObject, error in
    // Handle result
})
```

```kotlin Android
// To get the current user follow information, use the code below.
fun getFollowInfo() {
    val userRepository = AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository()
    userRepository
        .relationship()
        .me()
        .getFollowInfo()
        .doOnNext { followInfo: AmityMyFollowInfo ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}

// To get the other's user follow information, use the code below with the userId parameter.
fun getFollowInfo(userRepository: AmityUserRepository, userId: String) {
    userRepository
        .relationship()
        .user(userId = userId)
        .getFollowInfo()
        .doOnNext { followInfo: AmityUserFollowInfo ->
            //results
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

const unsubscriber = UserRepository.Relationship.getFollowInfo(
  'userId',
  ({ data: followInfo, loading, error }) => {
    if (loading) {
      // handle loading state
    }

    if (error) {
      // handle error
    }

    if (!loading && followInfo) {
      // handle follow info
      console.log('Follower count:', followInfo.followerCount);
      console.log('Following count:', followInfo.followingCount);
    }
  },
);
```

```dart Flutter
// To get the current user follow information, use the code below.
void getFollowInfo() {
  AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository()
      .relationship()
      .getMyFollowInfo()
      .then((myFollowInfo) => {
            //my follower count
            myFollowInfo.followerCount,
            //my following count
            myFollowInfo.followingCount
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}

// To get the other's user follow information, use the code below with the userId parameter.
void getFollowInfo(String userId) {
  AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository()
      .relationship()
      .getFollowInfo(userId)
      .then((otherFollowInfo) => {
            //my follower count
            otherFollowInfo.followerCount,
            //my following count
            otherFollowInfo.followingCount
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
