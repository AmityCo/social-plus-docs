## Overview

User relationships in Social Plus are built on two core systems: **Following** and **Blocking**. These systems work together to provide users with control over their social experience, privacy, and safety.

---

## Blocking & Unblocking Users

Blocking allows users to protect themselves from unwanted interactions, harassment, or spam. When a user is blocked:
- Their content is hidden from the blocker's feeds (global, community, user feed)
- They cannot comment, react, or post on the blocker's content
- The connection status becomes `none` and following is disabled
- Search visibility remains, but interactions are restricted

Unblocking restores content visibility and re-enables interactions, but the connection status remains `none` until a new follow is initiated.

  <Card title="User Safety & Privacy" icon="user-shield">
    Protect users from harassment and unwanted interactions. Blocked users cannot engage or view private content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Control" icon="filter">
    Blocked users' content is filtered from all feeds and interactions are disabled.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Blocking is a permanent action until reversed. Always provide clear feedback and management options for users.
</Info>

### Product Behavior for Blocked/Unblocked Users
- Blocked users' content is hidden from all feeds
- Search still shows blocked users, but interactions are disabled
- Blocked users cannot follow, comment, or react to the blocker's content
- Unblocking restores visibility and interaction, but does not restore previous connection status

## Following & Unfollowing Users

Following relationships are one-directional. When User A follows User B:
- User A is a follower of User B
- User B is not automatically following User A
- Connections can be direct or request-based, depending on network settings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Following" icon="bolt">
    Instant connection, no approval required. Suitable for public or open networks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request-based Following" icon="lock">
    Requires approval from the target user. Suitable for privacy-focused or professional networks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Connection Methods
- **Direct**: Follow action creates immediate connection
- **Request-based**: Follow action sends a request, target user must approve

<Info>
Network settings determine whether following is direct or request-based. This can be configured via API.
