      description: "Join us for our annual community gathering",
      type: AmityEventType.InPerson,
      startTime: "2025-02-15T18:00:00Z",

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timezone Handling" icon="clock">
    Always store and transmit times in ISO 8601 format with timezone information:
    
    - Use UTC for storage
    - Include timezone in metadata
    - Display times in user's local timezone
    - Account for daylight saving changes
    
    ```typescript
    import { EventRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

    const { data: event } = await EventRepository.createEvent({
      // ... other required fields
      startTime: "2025-02-15T18:00:00Z", // UTC
      metadata: {
        timezone: "America/New_York" // Display timezone
      }
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Event Scheduling" icon="calendar">
    Consider these factors when scheduling events:
    
    - Allow sufficient lead time for promotion
    - Check for conflicting events
    - Consider timezone differences for virtual events
    - Set appropriate end times
    - Send reminder notifications
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Management" icon="shield">
    Implement proper permission checks:
    
    ```typescript
    // Check global permission
    const canCreate = await client.hasPermission(
      AmityPermission.CREATE_EVENT
    );
    
    // Check community permission
    const canCreateInCommunity = await client.hasPermission(
      AmityPermission.CREATE_EVENT,
      communityId
    );
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Event Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Optimize event queries for better discovery:
    
    - Use appropriate filters (status, type, origin)
    - Sort by relevant criteria (start time, creation date)
    - Implement pagination for large result sets
    - Cache frequently accessed events
