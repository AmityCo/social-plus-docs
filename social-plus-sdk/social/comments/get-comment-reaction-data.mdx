# Get Comment Reaction Data

The `myReactions` property allows users to retrieve a list of all reactions they have made on a particular comment. This feature makes it easy for users to keep track of their own reactions and to see how their engagement with the post has evolved over time.

The `reactions` property, on the other hand, provides a list of all reactions made on the post. This includes reactions made by other users, providing a broader perspective on the post's overall engagement and sentiment.

Finally, the `reactionsCount` property provides a simple way to get the total count of reactions on a comment. By using this property, users can quickly see how popular a post is and how engaged the community is with the content.
