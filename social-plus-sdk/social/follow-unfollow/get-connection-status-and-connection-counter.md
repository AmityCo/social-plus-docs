# Get Connection Status and Connection Counter

### Connection Status

Before following other users, it is important to verify the connection status of the target user. Our SDK provides three statuses to indicate the connection status of the target user:

* `accept`: This status means that the target user has already connected.
* `pending`: This status means that the target user has received a follow request, but has not yet accepted it. This status is only available when the connection method setting is [With the request process](./#user-connection-method-concept).
* `none`: This status means that the target user has not yet connected.
* `blocked`: This status means that the target user has been blocked by the current user. For further information regarding blocked/unblocked users, please visit [block-and-unblock-user.md](../block-and-unblock-user.md "mention").

### Connection Counter

In addition to these statuses, our SDK also provides information about the following and follower count of the target user:

* `followingCount`: This is the total number of users that the target user is following.
* `followerCount`: This is the total number of users who are following the target user.
* `pendingCount`: This is the total number of follow-up requests that the target user has received.

By providing this information, our product allows users to manage their social connections effectively and efficiently, based on their specific needs and preferences.
