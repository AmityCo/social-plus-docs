## Deletion Types Overview

Understanding the differences between soft and hard deletion helps you choose the appropriate method for your content management strategy.

| Deletion Type | Data Preservation | Use Case |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Soft Delete** | ✅ Data preserved | ✅ Content moderation |
| **Hard Delete** | ❌ Data permanently removed | ✅ GDPR compliance, permanent removal |

<Warning>
**Hard deletion is irreversible.** Once a story is hard deleted, all associated data including reactions, comments, and analytics are permanently removed and cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Soft Delete Story

Soft deletion marks a story as deleted by setting the `isDeleted` flag to `true`, making it invisible to users while preserving all data for potential recovery or compliance purposes.

### When to Use Soft Delete
- **Content Moderation**: Hide inappropriate content while maintaining evidence
- **User Requests**: Allow users to delete their own content
- **Compliance Requirements**: Maintain audit trails while hiding content

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `storyId` | String | Yes | Unique identifier of the story to soft delete |

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
do {
    try await storyRepository.softDeleteStory(storyId: "storyId")
    // story successfully soft deleted
} catch {
    // Catch error when deleting
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun softDeleteStory(
    storyRepository: AmityStoryRepository,
    story: AmityStory
) {
    storyRepository.softDeleteStory(storyId = story.getStoryId())
        .doOnComplete {
            // Complete
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript Typescript
import { StoryRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

export const SoftDeleteStory = () => {
  StoryRepository.softDeleteStory('storyId');
};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Hard Delete Story

Hard deletion permanently removes a story and all associated data including reactions, comments, analytics, and media files from the database. This action is irreversible and should be used carefully.

### When to Use Hard Delete
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to be forgotten requests requiring complete data removal
- **Legal Requirements**: Court orders or regulatory mandates for data destruction
- **Storage Optimization**: Permanent cleanup of obsolete content to reduce storage costs
- **Security Incidents**: Complete removal of compromised or malicious content

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `storyId` | String | Yes | Unique identifier of the story to permanently delete |

<Tip>
Consider implementing a confirmation workflow for hard deletions, especially for administrator actions, to prevent accidental permanent data loss.

```swift iOS
do {
    try await storyRepository.hardDeleteStory(storyId: "storyId")
    // story successfully soft deleted
} catch {
    // Catch error when deleting
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun hardDeleteStory(
    storyRepository: AmityStoryRepository,
    story: AmityStory
) {
    storyRepository.hardDeleteStory(storyId = story.getStoryId())
        .doOnComplete {
            // Complete
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript Typescript
import { StoryRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

export const HardDeleteStory = () => {
  StoryRepository.hardDeleteStory('storyId');
};
