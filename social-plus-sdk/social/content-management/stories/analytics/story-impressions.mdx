<Info>
**Impressions** represent the total number of times a story has been viewed, while **reach** represents the number of unique users who have viewed the story. Story impression data is updated in near real-time for optimal performance.
</Info>

## Analytics Metrics

Impression tracking provides essential metrics for story performance analysis and user engagement insights.

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Impressions** | Total number of times a story has been viewed | Track overall content visibility and exposure |
| **Reach** | Number of unique users who viewed the story | Measure audience size and content distribution |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | Percentage of users who clicked story links | Assess hyperlink effectiveness and engagement |

## Marking Stories as Seen

Track user interactions by marking stories as seen when they are viewed in story feeds or opened in story viewers.

<Warning>
Stories must be in `SYNCED` sync state to be marked as seen. Attempting to mark unsynced stories will result in an error.
</Warning>

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect View Event">
    Determine when a story should be considered "seen" (e.g., visible in story viewer, minimum view duration reached).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Sync State">
    Ensure the story is in `SYNCED` state before marking as seen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark as Seen">
    Call the analytics method to record the impression and update the `isSeen` state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Metrics">
    Retrieve updated impression and reach counts from the story object.
  </Step>

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
fun queryStoryReachedUsers(
    userRepository: AmityUserRepository,
    storyId: String
) {
    //Query viewed users
    userRepository
        .getReachedUsers(viewedType = AmityViewedType.STORY, viewedId = storyId)
        .doOnNext { users: PagingData<AmityUser> ->
            // PagingData<AmityUser>
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun markStoryAsSeen(
    story: AmityStory
) {
    // available as extension function
    story.analytics()
        .markAsSeen()
}
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { StoryRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

export const MarkSeenStory = () => {
  const unsubscribe = StoryRepository.getActiveStoriesByTarget(
    {
      targetType: 'community',
      targetId: 'communityId',
    },
    ({ data: storiesData, loading, error }) => {
      // Pagination is not supported in this function
      if (error) {
        // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
      }
      if (loading) {
        // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
      }
      if (storiesData) {
        // Process the data
        storiesData.forEach(storyItem => {
          if (!storyItem) return;

          // Mark a current story as seen
          storyItem.analytics.markAsSeen();
        });
      }
    },
  );

  // Call to unsubscribe live collection
  unsubscribe();
};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tracking Link Interactions

Monitor user engagement with story hyperlinks to measure content effectiveness and click-through rates.

<Warning>
Stories must be in `SYNCED` sync state to track link clicks. This ensures accurate analytics data collection.
</Warning>

### Link Click Analytics

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
// storyObject is a type of `AmityStory`.
storyObject.analytics.markLinkAsClicked()
```

```kotlin Android
fun markStoryAsSeen(
    story: AmityStory
) {
    // available as extension function
    story.analytics()
        .markLinkAsClicked()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { StoryRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

export const markLinkAsClicked = () => {
  const unsubscribe = StoryRepository.getActiveStoriesByTarget(
    {
      targetType: 'community',
      targetId: 'communityId',
    },
    ({ data: storiesData, loading, error }) => {
      // Pagination is not supported in this function
      if (error) {
        // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
      }
      if (loading) {
        // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
      }
      if (storiesData) {
        // Process the data
        storiesData.forEach(storyItem => {
          if (!storyItem) return;

          // Mark a current story as seen
          storyItem.analytics.markLinkAsClicked();
        });
      }
    },
  );

  // Call to unsubscribe live collection
  unsubscribe();
};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Querying Story Reached Users

Retrieve detailed information about users who have viewed specific stories, enabling audience analysis and engagement insights.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `viewedType` | Enum | Yes | Type of content viewed (use `.STORY`) |
| `viewedId` | String | Yes | Unique identifier of the story |

### User Reach Analytics

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
token = userRepository.getReachedUsers(viewedType: .story, viewedId: "story-id").observe { Collection, change, error in
    // Handle list of reach users here.
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryStoryReachedUsers(
    userRepository: AmityUserRepository,
    storyId: String
) {
    //Query viewed users
    userRepository
        .getReachedUsers(viewedType = AmityViewedType.STORY, viewedId = storyId)
        .doOnNext { users: PagingData<AmityUser> ->
            // PagingData<AmityUser>
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

const unsubscribe = UserRepository.getReachedUsers(
  {
    viewId: 'storyId',
    viewedType: 'story',
    limit: 10,
  },
  ({ data: userData, loading, error }) => {
    if (error) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during retrieving data
    }
    if (loading) {
      // Handle the loading state, e.g., show a loading spinner
    }
    if (userData) {
      // Process the data
      console.log(userData);
    }
  },
);

// Call to unsubscribe live collection
unsubscribe();
```
