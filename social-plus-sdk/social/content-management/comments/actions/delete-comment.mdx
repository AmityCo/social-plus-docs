## Deletion Types

Understanding when to use soft delete versus hard delete is crucial for effective content moderation and data management.

| Deletion Type | Use Case | Data Retention | Reversible | Best For |
|---------------|----------|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Soft Delete** | Content moderation, policy violations | Data preserved with `isDeleted: true` | Yes | Flagged content, temporary removal |
| **Hard Delete** | Inappropriate content, GDPR compliance | Data permanently removed | No | Spam, severe violations, data purging |

<Info>
Soft delete is the default behavior when the `hardDelete` parameter is not specified or set to `false`.
</Info>


### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `commentId` | String | Yes | Unique identifier of the comment to delete |
| `hardDelete` | Boolean | No | `true` for permanent removal, `false` for soft delete (default) |

<Note>
Soft deleted comments can maintain their position in a collection and preserve all metadata for audit purposes.
</Note>

```swift iOS
// Hard Delete a comment
do {
    let success = try await commentRepository.hardDeleteComment(withId: "<comment-id>")
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}

// Soft Delete a comment
do {
    let success = try await commentRepository.softDeleteComment(withId: "<comment-id>")
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun deleteComment(commentRepository: AmityCommentRepository) {
    commentRepository.deleteComment(commentId = "comment123", hardDelete = true)
        .doOnComplete {
            //complete
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommentRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function deleteComment(commentId: Amity.Comment['commentId']): Promise<any> {
  const softDeletedComment = await CommentRepository.deleteComment(commentId);

  const hardDeletedComment = await CommentRepository.deleteComment(commentId, true);

  return [hardDeletedComment, softDeletedComment];
}
```

```dart Flutter
//current parent comment collection
final _amityComments = <AmityComment>[];

void deleteomment(AmityComment comment) {
  comment
      .delete()
      .then((value) => {
            //success
            //optional: to remove the deleted comment from the current post collection
            //you will need manually remove the deleted comment from the collection
            //for example :
            _amityComments.removeWhere(
                (element) => element.commentId == comment.commentId)
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```

<Warning>
Hard delete removes ALL associated data including:

- All reactions and reactions metadata  
- All replies to the comment
