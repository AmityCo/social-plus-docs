title: "Post Impressions"
description: "Track post views, engagement metrics, and analyze content performance with impression and reach analytics"
---

Post impressions provide powerful analytics capabilities to track how users interact with content. This feature enables content creators and community managers to gain valuable insights into post performance, user engagement patterns, and content reach across their communities.

<Info>
**Impressions** represent the total number of times a post has been viewed, while **reach** represents the number of unique users who have viewed the post. Post impression data is updated in near real-time for optimal performance.

## Analytics Metrics

Impression tracking provides essential metrics for content performance analysis and user engagement insights.

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Impressions** | Total number of times a post has been viewed | Track overall content visibility and exposure |
| **Reach** | Number of unique users who viewed the post | Measure audience size and content distribution |
| **View Rate** | Percentage of users who viewed vs. total followers | Assess content relevance and engagement quality |


## Marking Posts as Viewed

Track user interactions by marking posts as viewed when they appear in the user's feed or are specifically opened.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect View Event">
    Determine when a post should be considered "viewed" (e.g., visible in feed, opened in detail).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark as Viewed">
    Call the analytics method to record the impression.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Metrics">
    Retrieve updated impression and reach counts from the post object.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update UI">
    Display analytics data in your interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
// To mark a post as viewed.
post.analytics.markAsViewed()
//
// ...
//
// To view the number of impression and reach
let impression = post.impression
let reach = post.reach
```

```kotlin Android
fun markPostAsViewed(
    post: AmityPost
) {
    // mark post as viewed
    post.analytics()
        .markAsViewed()

    // post impression and reach count
    post.getImpression()
    post.getReach()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { PostRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

const subscribeToPosts = (targetId: Amity.Post['targetId'], targetType: Amity.Post['targetType']) => {
  const unsubscribe = PostRepository.getPosts(
    { targetId, targetType },
    ({ data: posts }) => {
      if (posts) {
        posts.forEach(post => post.analytics.markAsViewed());
      }
    },
  );

  return unsubscribe;
};
```

```dart Flutter 
void markPostAsViewed(AmityPost post) {
  // To mark post as viewed
  post.analytics().markPostAsViewed();
  // To get Impressions
  post.impression;
  // To get Reach
  post.reach;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Query Reached Users

Retrieve detailed information about which users have viewed specific posts to gain insights into your audience and content performance.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `viewedType` | AmityViewedType | Yes | Type of content viewed (use `.post` for posts) |
| `viewedId` | String | Yes | ID of the post to query reached users for |

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
let token = userRepository.getReachedUsers(viewedType: .post, viewedId: "post-id").observe { Collection, change, error in
    // Handle list of reach users here.
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun queryPostReachedUsers(
    userRepository: AmityUserRepository,
    postId: String
) {
    //Query viewed users
    userRepository
        .getReachedUsers(viewedType = AmityViewedType.POST, viewedId = postId)
        .doOnNext { users: PagingData<AmityUser> ->
            // PagingData<AmityUser>
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';
import { FC, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const GetViewedUsers: FC<{ postId: string }> = ({ postId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<(Amity.User | undefined)[]>();
  const [nextPage, setNextPage] = useState<() => void | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const disposers: Amity.Unsubscriber[] = [];

    const unsubscribeUser = UserRepository.getViewedUsers(
      { postId: 'post_id', limit: 10 },
      ({ data: users, loading, error, hasNextPage, onNextPage }) => {
        if (!loading || error) return;

        if (users) {
          setUser(users);
        }

        if (hasNextPage) {
          setNextPage(onNextPage);
        } else {
          setNextPage(undefined);
        }
      },
    );

    disposers.push(unsubscribeUser);

    // cleanup on unmounting
    return () => disposers.forEach(fn => fn());
  }, [postId]);

  return null;
};
```

```dart Flutter 
final _amityUsers = <AmityUser>[];
late PagingController<AmityUser> _amityUsersController;
final scrollcontroller = ScrollController();

void getPostReachedUsers(String postId) {
  _amityUsersController = PagingController(
    pageFuture: (token) => AmityCoreClient.newUserRepository()
        .getViewedUsers(viewedId: postId, viewedType: AmityViewedType.POST)
        .getPagingData(token: token, limit: 10),
    pageSize: 20,
  )..addListener(
      () {
        if (_amityUsersController.error == null) {
          //handle _amityUsersController, we suggest to clear the previous items
          //and add with the latest _controller.loadedItems
          _amityUsers.clear();
          _amityUsers.addAll(_amityUsersController.loadedItems);
          //update widgets
        } else {
          //error on pagination controller
          //update widgets
        }
      },
    );

  // To fetch the first page
  _amityUsersController.fetchNextPage();
  _amityUsersController.addListener(pagination);
}

void pagination() {
  if ((scrollcontroller.position.pixels ==
          scrollcontroller.position.maxScrollExtent) &&
      _amityUsersController.hasMoreItems) {
    _amityUsersController.fetchNextPage();
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    - **Debounce View Events**: Prevent multiple impressions from rapid scrolling
    - **Batch Analytics Calls**: Group multiple post views for efficient API usage
    - **Cache Analytics Data**: Store impression counts locally to reduce API calls
    - **Background Processing**: Handle analytics operations asynchronously
    - **Memory Management**: Properly dispose of observation tokens
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Experience">
    - **Non-blocking Operations**: Don't let analytics calls slow down the UI
    - **Privacy Considerations**: Respect user privacy when tracking view data
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Handle analytics failures without affecting core functionality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Accuracy">
    - **View Threshold**: Define minimum view time before marking as viewed
    - **Unique Tracking**: Ensure each user is counted only once per post
    - **Validation**: Verify analytics data integrity before displaying
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analytics Strategy">
    - **Meaningful Metrics**: Focus on metrics that drive business decisions
    - **Trend Analysis**: Track changes over time rather than absolute numbers
    - **Segmentation**: Analyze performance by user groups or content types
    - **A/B Testing**: Use analytics to validate content strategy changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Impressions not updating">
    - Verify that `markAsViewed()` is being called correctly
    - Check network connectivity for analytics data sync
    - Ensure user has proper permissions to view the post
    - Test with different posts to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reached users query failing">
    - Confirm post exists and is accessible
    - Check if the post has any actual impressions
    - Test with posts that have known viewers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Analytics data inconsistency">
    - Allow time for near real-time updates to propagate
    - Check if users are being counted multiple times
    - Verify that view tracking is working across different entry points
    - Review analytics implementation for race conditions
  </Accordion>
