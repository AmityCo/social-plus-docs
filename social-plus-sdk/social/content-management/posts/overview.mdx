Posts are the foundation of content creation and sharing in social.plus. A post can include text, images, videos, files, polls, live streams, or custom content—enabling users to express themselves, share information, and connect with others in a network or community.

<Info>
  Posts support real-time events and Live Object features. See [Live
  Objects/Collections](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/live-objects-collections/overview)
  and [Realtime
  Events](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/realtime-events/overview)
  for more.
</Info>

## Post Structure

Posts use a parent-child relationship:

- The parent post acts as a container (e.g., for text or metadata)
- Each image, video, or file is a separate child post
- Both parent and child posts support reactions and comments

Example: An image post with three images will have one parent post (text container) and three child posts (each with an image).

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Parent Post] --> B[Text Content]
    A --> C[Child Post 1]
    A --> D[Child Post 2]
    A --> E[Child Post 3]
    C --> F[Image]
    D --> G[Image]
    E --> H[Image]
    A --> I[Reactions]
    A --> J[Comments]
    C --> K[Child Reactions]
```

<Info>
  Users can interact (react, comment) with both parent and child posts, enabling
  rich engagement.
</Info>

## Post Structure Types

Every post has a `structureType` field that automatically classifies its content composition. This enables precise filtering and querying of posts based on their media content.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pure Structure Types" icon="file">
    Posts containing a single type of content or attachment:
    
    | Structure Type | Description | Use Case |
    |----------------|-------------|----------|
    | `text` | Text-only content, no attachments | Announcements, discussions, status updates |
    | `image` | Only image attachments (1-10 images) | Photo galleries, visual content |
    | `video` | Only video attachments | Video tutorials, recordings |
    | `audio` | Only audio attachments | Podcasts, voice messages, audio content |
    | `file` | Only file attachments | Document sharing, PDFs, presentations |
    | `liveStream` | Live streaming content | Live broadcasts, real-time events |
    | `poll` | Poll/survey content | Voting, feedback collection |
    | `clip` | Short-form video content (up to 15 min) | Quick videos, highlights |
    
    **Example Query**: Get only photo posts (pure images)
    ```typescript
    const posts = await PostRepository.getPosts({
      dataTypes: ['image'],
      includeMixedStructure: false // Only pure image posts
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mixed Structure Type" icon="layer-group">
    **Structure Type**: `mixed`
    
    Posts that combine multiple media types in a single post. A post is classified as `mixed` when it contains 2 or more distinct attachment types (image, video, audio, file).
    
    **Examples of Mixed Posts**:
    - Tutorial with images + instructional video
    - Product showcase with photos + demo video + spec sheet PDF
    - Event coverage with photos + highlight video + audio interview
    - Educational content with diagrams + explanatory video + downloadable resources
    
    **Creation**: Use `createMixedMediaPost()` or `createMixedAttachmentPost()` to combine different media types.
    
    **Querying**: Control whether mixed posts appear in filtered results using `includeMixedStructure`:
    ```typescript
    // Include mixed posts that contain images
    const posts = await PostRepository.getPosts({
      dataTypes: ['image'],
      includeMixedStructure: true // Includes pure + mixed with images
    });
    ```

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structure Type Behavior" icon="info-circle">
    **Automatic Classification**
    - The `structureType` is automatically assigned based on post attachments
    - No manual specification needed
    - Updates automatically when post is edited
    
    **Query Filtering**
    - By default, single-type queries return only pure structure posts
    - Use `includeMixedStructure: true` to include mixed posts containing that type
    - Multi-type queries automatically include mixed posts
    
    See [Query Posts](/social-plus-sdk/social/content-management/posts/retrieval/query-posts#mixed-media-filtering) for filtering details.

## Live Comment Count

The `localCommentCount` property provides a real-time comment count on a post. It updates instantly when comments are created or deleted — both from the current user's own actions and from real-time events received from other users — so your UI always reflects the latest activity without refetching the entire post.

To receive these updates, you must observe the post through a **Live Object** (via `getPost()`) or a **Live Collection** (via `queryPosts()`). The SDK delivers `localCommentCount` changes through the same observation callback you already use for other post property updates. See [Live Objects & Collections](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/live-objects-collections/overview) for details.

### How It Works

`localCommentCount` starts with the server's `commentsCount` value when a post is loaded. From that point on, the SDK adjusts the count locally as comment events arrive:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Post loaded from server\ncommentsCount = 12"] --> B["localCommentCount = 12"]
    B --> C{"Comment events"}
    C -->|"Comment created"| D["localCommentCount = 13"]
    C -->|"Comment deleted"| E["localCommentCount = 11"]
    C -->|"Post re-fetched from server"| F["Re-calibrated to latest\nserver commentsCount"]
```

- **Local actions**: When the current user creates or deletes a comment, the count updates immediately after the server confirms the action.
- **Remote events**: When another user creates or deletes a comment, the SDK receives a real-time event and adjusts the count.
- **Re-calibration**: Every time the post object is refreshed from the server (e.g., via a query or pagination), `localCommentCount` resets to the server's `commentsCount`, ensuring eventual consistency.

<Info>
`localCommentCount` includes **all comment levels** — both top-level comments and replies. It matches how `commentsCount` works on the server.
</Info>

### When to Use `localCommentCount` vs `commentsCount`

| Property | Updates from real-time events? | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `commentsCount` | No — reflects the server value at the time the post was last fetched | Static displays or cases where you always re-fetch the post before showing the count |
| `localCommentCount` | Yes — updates instantly via local actions and real-time events | Displaying live counters in feeds, post detail views, and active discussions |

<Tip>
For most UI use cases, **prefer `localCommentCount`** to give users an immediate sense of activity. The value will re-calibrate to the server count automatically whenever the post is refreshed.
</Tip>

### Prerequisites

Two things must be in place for `localCommentCount` to deliver live updates:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observe the post via Live Object or Live Collection">
    You must be observing the post through `getPost()` (Live Object) or `queryPosts()` (Live Collection). The SDK delivers `localCommentCount` changes through the observation callback — if you're not observing, you won't receive updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to real-time events">
    To receive other users' comment activity, subscribe to the relevant post and comment topic. Without a subscription, `localCommentCount` will only reflect the current user's own actions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Choose the subscription scope that matches your UI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Community Feed">
    Subscribe to all post and comment events in a community — ideal for community feeds where you want live counters on every post.

    ```typescript
    import { getCommunityTopic, SubscriptionLevels } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

    // Subscribe to all post + comment events in this community
    const topic = getCommunityTopic(community, SubscriptionLevels.POST_AND_COMMENT);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Single Post">
    Subscribe to comment events on a specific post — ideal for post detail views or expanded threads.

    ```typescript
    import { getPostTopic, SubscriptionLevels } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

    // Subscribe to comment events on this specific post
    const topic = getPostTopic(post, SubscriptionLevels.COMMENT);
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Real-time events are **not available for global feed queries**. Use community-level or post-level subscriptions instead. See [Social Real-time Events](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/realtime-events/social-realtime-events) for the full list of subscription topics.
</Note>

### Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Eventual consistency, not absolute accuracy" icon="clock">
    Because the count is computed locally from a stream of events, it may temporarily diverge from the true server count in high-traffic scenarios (e.g., hundreds of comments per second). The SDK automatically re-calibrates whenever fresh post data is fetched from the server, so any drift is short-lived.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requires Live Object/Collection observation and real-time subscription" icon="wifi">
    Updates are delivered through the Live Object or Live Collection observation callback. If you fetch a post without observing it, you won't receive `localCommentCount` changes. Additionally, without subscribing to the relevant post/comment real-time topic, the count will only reflect the current user's own create/delete actions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not supported on global feed" icon="globe">
    Real-time events are scoped to communities, individual posts, or user feeds. If you display posts from a global feed query, `localCommentCount` will still work for the current user's own actions but won't receive remote events until you subscribe at a tighter scope (community or post level).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
