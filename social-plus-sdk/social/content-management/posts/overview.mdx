Posts are the foundation of content creation and sharing in Social Plus. A post can include text, images, videos, files, polls, live streams, or custom contentâ€”enabling users to express themselves, share information, and connect with others in a network or community.

## Post Structure
Posts use a parent-child relationship:
- The parent post acts as a container (e.g., for text or metadata)
- Each image, video, or file is a separate child post
- Both parent and child posts support reactions and comments

Example: An image post with three images will have one parent post (text container) and three child posts (each with an image).

graph TD
    A[Parent Post] --> B[Text Content]
    A --> C[Child Post 1]
    A --> D[Child Post 2]
    A --> E[Child Post 3]
    C --> F[Image]
    D --> G[Image]
    E --> H[Image]
    A --> I[Reactions]
    A --> J[Comments]
    C --> K[Child Reactions]
```


<Info>
Users can interact (react, comment) with both parent and child posts, enabling rich engagement.
