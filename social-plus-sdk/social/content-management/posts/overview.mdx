Posts are the foundation of content creation and sharing in social.plus. A post can include text, images, videos, files, polls, live streams, or custom contentâ€”enabling users to express themselves, share information, and connect with others in a network or community.

<Info>
  Posts support real-time events and Live Object features. See [Live
  Objects/Collections](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/live-objects-collections/overview)
  and [Realtime
  Events](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/realtime-communication/realtime-events/overview)
  for more.

## Post Structure

Posts use a parent-child relationship:

- The parent post acts as a container (e.g., for text or metadata)
- Each image, video, or file is a separate child post
- Both parent and child posts support reactions and comments

Example: An image post with three images will have one parent post (text container) and three child posts (each with an image).

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Parent Post] --> B[Text Content]
    A --> C[Child Post 1]
    A --> D[Child Post 2]
    A --> E[Child Post 3]
    C --> F[Image]
    D --> G[Image]
    E --> H[Image]
    A --> I[Reactions]
    A --> J[Comments]
    C --> K[Child Reactions]
```

<Info>
  Users can interact (react, comment) with both parent and child posts, enabling
  rich engagement.

## Post Structure Types

Every post has a `structureType` field that automatically classifies its content composition. This enables precise filtering and querying of posts based on their media content.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pure Structure Types" icon="file">
    Posts containing a single type of content or attachment:
    
    | Structure Type | Description | Use Case |
    |----------------|-------------|----------|
    | `text` | Text-only content, no attachments | Announcements, discussions, status updates |
    | `image` | Only image attachments (1-10 images) | Photo galleries, visual content |
    | `video` | Only video attachments | Video tutorials, recordings |
    | `audio` | Only audio attachments | Podcasts, voice messages, audio content |
    | `file` | Only file attachments | Document sharing, PDFs, presentations |
    | `liveStream` | Live streaming content | Live broadcasts, real-time events |
    | `poll` | Poll/survey content | Voting, feedback collection |
    | `clip` | Short-form video content (up to 15 min) | Quick videos, highlights |
    
    **Example Query**: Get only photo posts (pure images)
    ```typescript
    const posts = await PostRepository.getPosts({
      dataTypes: ['image'],
      includeMixedStructure: false // Only pure image posts
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mixed Structure Type" icon="layer-group">
    **Structure Type**: `mixed`
    
    Posts that combine multiple media types in a single post. A post is classified as `mixed` when it contains 2 or more distinct attachment types (image, video, audio, file).
    
    **Examples of Mixed Posts**:
    - Tutorial with images + instructional video
    - Product showcase with photos + demo video + spec sheet PDF
    - Event coverage with photos + highlight video + audio interview
    - Educational content with diagrams + explanatory video + downloadable resources
    
    **Creation**: Use `createMixedMediaPost()` or `createMixedAttachmentPost()` to combine different media types.
    
    **Querying**: Control whether mixed posts appear in filtered results using `includeMixedStructure`:
    ```typescript
    // Include mixed posts that contain images
    const posts = await PostRepository.getPosts({
      dataTypes: ['image'],
      includeMixedStructure: true // Includes pure + mixed with images
    });
    ```

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structure Type Behavior" icon="info-circle">
    **Automatic Classification**
    - The `structureType` is automatically assigned based on post attachments
    - No manual specification needed
    - Updates automatically when post is edited
    
    **Query Filtering**
    - By default, single-type queries return only pure structure posts
    - Use `includeMixedStructure: true` to include mixed posts containing that type
    - Multi-type queries automatically include mixed posts
    
    See [Query Posts](/social-plus-sdk/social/content-management/posts/retrieval/query-posts#mixed-media-filtering) for filtering details.
