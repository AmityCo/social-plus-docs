| `targetType`            | Enum    | ✅        | Type of the target, either a particular community (`community`) or a user feed (`user`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `types`                 | Array   | ❌        | Available post types: `video`, `image`, `file`, `liveStream`, `poll`, and `custom`. If not specified, returns all post types for the target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `tags`                  | Array   | ❌        | Filter posts by specific tags. When specified, only posts containing these tags will be returned.

| `includeDeleted`        | Boolean | ❌        | Deletion filter. When `true`, retrieves both deleted and non-deleted posts. When `false` (default), only non-deleted posts are returned. Excludes all deleted posts (both soft and hard deleted) not owned by the logged-in user. Community moderators can see soft-deleted posts in community feeds, while users can see their own soft-deleted posts in their user feeds. |
| `sortBy`                | Enum    | ❌        | Sort order for results. `lastCreated` (default) shows most recently created posts first, `firstCreated` shows earliest created posts first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `feedType`              | Enum    | ❌        | Type of the feed filter. Possible values: `published`, `reviewing`, `declined`. See [Feed Types](#feed-types) for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `includeMixedStructure` | Boolean | ❌        | Mixed media filter. When `true`, posts with mixed media (combining multiple media types) are included in results when filtering by `types`. When `false` (default), only posts with pure single-type structures are returned. See [Mixed Media Filtering](#mixed-media-filtering) for details.                                                                              |

### Feed Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Published Posts">
    **Value**: `published`

    Posts that have been approved and are visible to community members. This is the default state for most posts in communities without review requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reviewing Posts">
    **Value**: `reviewing`

    Posts that are pending moderator approval. These posts are only visible to the post author and community moderators until approved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Declined Posts">
    **Value**: `declined`

    Posts that have been rejected by moderators. These posts are only visible to the post author and community moderators.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Mixed Media Filtering

<Info>
  The `includeMixedStructure` parameter controls whether posts with mixed media types are included when filtering by specific post types. This is particularly useful when querying for content galleries or type-specific feeds.
</Info>

Posts can have different structure types based on their attachments:

- **Pure Structure**: Posts with a single media type (e.g., only images, only videos, only audio files)
- **Mixed Structure**: Posts combining multiple media types (e.g., images + videos, audio + files, any combination)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Behavior (false)">
    When `includeMixedStructure = false` (default), querying for specific types returns only posts with pure single-type structures:

    ```typescript
    // Query for images only
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community",
      types: ["image"],
      includeMixedStructure: false  // or omit (default)
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Posts with ONLY images (structureType: 'image')
    // ❌ Posts with images + videos (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ❌ Posts with images + audio (structureType: 'mixed')
    ```

    This is ideal for:

    - Pure photo galleries
    - Type-specific content feeds
    - Simplified content categorization
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Include Mixed (true)">
    When `includeMixedStructure = true`, querying for specific types returns both pure and mixed structure posts containing that type:

    ```typescript
    // Query for images including mixed media
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community",
      types: ["image"],
      includeMixedStructure: true
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Posts with ONLY images (structureType: 'image')
    // ✅ Posts with images + videos (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ✅ Posts with images + audio (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ✅ Any mixed post containing at least one image
    ```

    This is ideal for:

    - Comprehensive media searches
    - Finding all content featuring a specific media type
    - Flexible content discovery
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No Type Filter">
    When `types` parameter is omitted or empty, all post types are returned regardless of `includeMixedStructure`:

    ```typescript
    // Query all posts (no type filter)
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community"
      // types not specified
      // includeMixedStructure is ignored
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Text-only posts (structureType: null)
    // ✅ Pure image posts (structureType: 'image')
    // ✅ Pure video posts (structureType: 'video')
    // ✅ Pure audio posts (structureType: 'audio')
    // ✅ Pure file posts (structureType: 'file')
    // ✅ Mixed media posts (structureType: 'mixed')
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
