The social.plus SDK provides powerful post querying functionality that enables flexible content discovery and filtering. Query posts from communities, user feeds, or across the entire platform with customizable search criteria and real-time results.


<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Live Collection" icon="square-bolt">
    Query results are returned as live collections with real-time updates
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flexible Filtering" icon="filter">
    Filter by post type, target, deletion status, and custom criteria
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `targetId` | String | Yes | ID of the community or user respectively. Use community ID for community posts or user ID for user feed posts. |
| `targetType` | Enum | Yes | Type of the target, either a particular community (`community`) or a user feed (`user`). |
| `types` | Array | No | Available post types: `video`, `image`, `file`, `audio`, `liveStream`, `poll`, and `custom`. If not specified, returns all post types for the target. |
| `tags` | Array | No | Filter posts by specific tags. When specified, only posts containing these tags will be returned. Useful for content categorization and topic-based filtering. |
| `includeDeleted` | Boolean | No | Deletion filter. When `true`, retrieves both deleted and non-deleted posts. When `false` (default), only non-deleted posts are returned. Excludes all deleted posts (both soft and hard deleted) not owned by the logged-in user. Community moderators can see soft-deleted posts in community feeds, while users can see their own soft-deleted posts in their user feeds. |
| `includeMixedStructure` | Boolean | No | Mixed media filter. When `true`, posts with mixed media (combining multiple media types) are included in results when filtering by `types`. When `false` (default), only posts with pure single-type structures are returned. See [Mixed Media Filtering](#mixed-media-filtering) for details. |
| `sortBy` | Enum | No | Sort order for results. `lastCreated` (default) shows most recently created posts first, `firstCreated` shows earliest created posts first. |
| `feedType` | Enum | No | Type of the feed filter. Possible values: `published`, `reviewing`, `declined`. See [Feed Types](#feed-types) for details. |

### Feed Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Published Posts">
    **Value**: `published`
    
    Posts that have been approved and are visible to community members. This is the default state for most posts in communities without review requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reviewing Posts">
    **Value**: `reviewing`
    
    Posts that are pending moderator approval. These posts are only visible to the post author and community moderators until approved.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Declined Posts">
    **Value**: `declined`
    
    Posts that have been rejected by moderators. These posts are only visible to the post author and community moderators.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Mixed Media Filtering

<Info>
The `includeMixedStructure` parameter controls whether posts with mixed media types are included when filtering by specific post types. This is particularly useful when querying for content galleries or type-specific feeds.
</Info>

Posts can have different structure types based on their attachments:
- **Pure Structure**: Posts with a single media type (e.g., only images, only videos, only audio files)
- **Mixed Structure**: Posts combining multiple media types (e.g., images + videos, audio + files, any combination)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Behavior (false)">
    When `includeMixedStructure = false` (default), querying for specific types returns only posts with pure single-type structures:
    
    ```typescript
    // Query for images only
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community",
      types: ["image"],
      includeMixedStructure: false  // or omit (default)
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Posts with ONLY images (structureType: 'image')
    // ❌ Posts with images + videos (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ❌ Posts with images + audio (structureType: 'mixed')
    ```
    
    This is ideal for:
    - Pure photo galleries
    - Type-specific content feeds
    - Simplified content categorization
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Include Mixed (true)">
    When `includeMixedStructure = true`, querying for specific types returns both pure and mixed structure posts containing that type:
    
    ```typescript
    // Query for images including mixed media
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community",
      types: ["image"],
      includeMixedStructure: true
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Posts with ONLY images (structureType: 'image')
    // ✅ Posts with images + videos (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ✅ Posts with images + audio (structureType: 'mixed')
    // ✅ Any mixed post containing at least one image
    ```
    
    This is ideal for:
    - Comprehensive media searches
    - Finding all content featuring a specific media type
    - Flexible content discovery
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="No Type Filter">
    When `types` parameter is omitted or empty, all post types are returned regardless of `includeMixedStructure`:
    
    ```typescript
    // Query all posts (no type filter)
    const options = {
      targetId: "community-123",
      targetType: "community"
      // types not specified
      // includeMixedStructure is ignored
    };
    
    // Returns:
    // ✅ Text-only posts (structureType: null)
    // ✅ Pure image posts (structureType: 'image')
    // ✅ Pure video posts (structureType: 'video')
    // ✅ Pure audio posts (structureType: 'audio')
    // ✅ Pure file posts (structureType: 'file')
    // ✅ Mixed media posts (structureType: 'mixed')
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
