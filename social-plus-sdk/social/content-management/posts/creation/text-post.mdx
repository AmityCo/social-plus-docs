  <Accordion title="Mention Format Issues" icon="at">
    **Problem**: Mentions not working properly
    
    **Solution**: Use correct format with @username (no spaces in username)
    
    ```typescript
    // ✅ Correct
    "Hello @john-doe, how are you?"
    
    // ❌ Incorrect  
    "Hello @john doe, how are you?"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Target Validation" icon="users-viewfinder">
    **Problem**: Post fails with invalid target error

    // For community posts, ensure user is a member
    const isMember = await CommunityRepository.isMember(communityId, userId);
    if (!isMember) {
      throw new Error('User must be a community member to post');
    }
    ```
