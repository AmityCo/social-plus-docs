# Get User Information

In the Social Plus SDK, a user is represented by an `AmityUser` object, which contains the user's unique `userId` and `displayName`. The `userId` is an immutable value that is assigned to a user when their account is created, and cannot be changed afterwards. This value serves as a unique identifier for the user within the SDK, and is used to perform actions such as sending messages or creating connections between users.

To retrieve an `AmityUser` object for a specific `userId`, you can use the `getUser` method provided by the `UserRepository`. This method accepts the `userId` as a parameter and returns a [Live Object](../live-objects-collections/) of `AmityUser`. The live object allows developers to observe changes to the user's properties in real-time, ensuring that their app remains up-to-date with the latest user information.

    Follow the below code to retrieve a user object:

    ```javascript
    import { UserRepository } from '@amityco/js-sdk';

    const liveObject = UserRepository.getUser('userId');
    liveObject.on('dataUpdated', user => {
      // user is successfully fetched
    });
    ```

    #### Get Single User

    The User Repository provides a method to get a single user. It returns a LiveObject which you can observe.

    ```javascript
    userRepo.userForId('user123')
    ```

    You can also use the code below to get one user:

    ```typescript
    let liveUser = UserRepository.getUser("some-user-id")
    userObject.on("dataUpdated", model => {
       // you can access user object as model here
      console.log(model.userId, model.displayName)
    })
    ```

    #### Get All Users

    The User Repository provides a method to get a list of all users, which will be returned as a LiveCollection:

    ```javascript
    userRepo.getAllUsers()
    ```

    This method takes an optional `sortBy` parameter which must be a `UserSortingMethod` - these include `displayName`, `firstCreated`, and `lastCreated`:

    ```javascript
    import { UserSortingMethod } from '@amityco/js-sdk'

    userRepo.getAllUsers(UserSortingMethod.DisplayName)
    ```

To retrieve multiple users, you can use `getUserByIds` method provided by `UserRepository`. This method accepts a collection of `userId` as a parameter and returns a [Live Collection](../live-objects-collections/) of `AmityUser`.
