# Roles & Permissions

`AmityClient` class provides a method `hasPermission` which allows you to check if the current logged-in user has permission to do stuff in a given channel.

We determine a user's moderation capabilities based on their current role. Social Plus SDK has the following default roles:

1. **Member** - has no moderation privileges
2. **Community/Channel Moderator** - can assert general moderation privileges on other users
3. **Super Moderator** - can assert general moderation privileges and be exempt from moderation from other users
4. **Global Admin** (Admin Only) - can assign the roles of others, assert all moderation privileges, and be exempt from moderation

A user's role can be changed via the Console. Refer to [Moderation, Roles & Privileges](../../../analytics-and-moderation/console/moderation-roles-and-privileges.md#change-user-role) for the instructions on how to change a user's role.

<Warning>
The Global Admin role cannot be assigned to a user.
</Warning>

Below are tables for each category that show the default roles and permissions.  You can create new roles and assign a specific set of permissions for each role in the SP Console. Refer to [Moderation, Roles & Privileges](../../../analytics-and-moderation/console/moderation-roles-and-privileges.md#create-role).

There is no limit to the number of moderators in a community. If there are 100 members in the community, all 100 members can be promoted to moderator. Promoting a user to a community-level moderator can be done using the [Update Role API](https://apidocs.dev.amity.co/#/Role/put_v3_roles__roleId) or through the SDK.
