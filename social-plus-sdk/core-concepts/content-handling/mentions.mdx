# Mentions

Mentions allow users to tag other users in messages, comments, and posts. It's a powerful tool for fostering engagement and collaboration within your social application, enabling users to directly alert others to new content or important updates.

<Note>
**Mention Support**: User mentions are supported in posts, comments, and messages. Channel mentions are available in messages only.

Upon creating a model above (a post, comment, or message) with a mention, you can include a JSON object in the metadata parameter. The metadata represents the mentioned object, which depends on the design of your data structure. However, we provide a default structure to help you create the mentioned metadata. 

To ensure prompt notification of the person mentioned, it's important to provide the list of user IDs for the mentioned user parameter. This will help ensure that the mentioned users are notified and able to engage with the content.

- `mentionUsers(userIds)` -  In order to mention users and notify specific users. This function supports all mentionable models. 

- `mentionChannel(channelId)` - In order to mention and notify the whole channel. This function supports only a message model. 

- `metadata` - a free-form JSON object that can accommodate any information regarding the mentioned users. Our default structure for representing mentions is also in the metadata property.

## Default Mention Data Structure
To represent mentions using our structure, you will need to utilize the AmityMention object. This object can be created during mentionable model creation, as well as during rendering.

## Creating Mention Metadata
Below is an example to create a comment with mentions by using our default mention metadata structure:


<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
import AmitySDK

func createCommentWithMentionExample() {
    // 1. We will create a comment containing this text.
    let text = "Hi @john and @alice."
    // To add mention to a comment, we need extra steps.
    // In this example, we want to mention two users "john" and "alice".
    //
    // 2. We create metadata that contains mention object, via AmityMentionMapper helper class.
    //
    // Notice how `index` and `length` is set.
    let metadata = AmityMentionMapper.metadata(from: [
        AmityMention(type: .user, index: 3, length: 4, userId: "<john-user-id>"),
        AmityMention(type: .user, index: 13, length: 5, userId: "<alice-user-id>")
    ])
    // 3. We create mentionees.
    let mentionees = AmityMentioneesBuilder()
    mentionees.mentionUsers(userIds: ["<john-user-id>", "<alice-user-id>"])
    // Finally we pass (1) (2) and (3) to create a comment with mention.
    
    let createOptions = AmityCommentCreateOptions(referenceId: "post-id", referenceType: .post, text: text, parentId: nil, metadata: metadata, mentioneeBuilder: mentionees)
    commentRepository.createComment(with: createOptions) { comment, error in
        // Comment
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun createCommentWithMention(
    commentRepository: AmityCommentRepository,
    postId: String,
) {
    val userId = "userId"
    val startMentionIndex = 0
    val mentionLength = 6
    //create AmityMentionMetadata from userId, startIndex and length
    val mentionMetadata: AmityMentionMetadata =
        AmityMentionMetadata.USER(
            userId = userId,
            index = startMentionIndex,
            length = mentionLength
        )
    //construct AmityMentionMetadata to JsonObject using AmityMentionMetadataCreator
    val mentionMetadataCreator: JsonObject =
        AmityMentionMetadataCreator(mentionMetaData = listOf(mentionMetadata)).create()
    //create a comment with mention
    commentRepository.createComment()
        .post(postId) // or .content(contentId) for content type posts 9 .contentId(contentId)
        .with()
        .text("@userId Hello world!")
        //mentionUsers to trigger push notifications
        .mentionUsers(userIds = listOf(userId))
        //metadata to render mention highlights
        .metadata(mentionMetadataCreator)
        .build()
        .send()
        .doOnSuccess { comment: AmityComment ->
            //success
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommentRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function createMentionComment(): Promise<Amity.Comment> {
  const newMentionComment = {
    data: {
      text: 'hello @userId1!',
    },
    referenceId: 'postId',
    referenceType: 'post' as Amity.CommentReferenceType,
    mentionees: [{ type: 'user', userIds: ['userId1'] }] as Amity.UserMention[],
  };

  const { data: comment } = await CommentRepository.createComment(newMentionComment);

  return comment;
}
```

```dart Flutter
//current parent comment collection
final _amityComments = <AmityComment>[];

//create comment to a post
void createComment(String postId) {
  const userId = 'userAId';
  const startMentionIndex = 0;
  const mentionLength = 6;
  //create AmityMentionMetadata from userId, startIndex and length
  final mentionMetadata = AmityUserMentionMetadata(
      userId: userId, index: startMentionIndex, length: mentionLength);
  //construct AmityMentionMetadata to JsonObject using AmityMentionMetadataCreator
  final mentionMetadataCreator =
      AmityMentionMetadataCreator([mentionMetadata]).create();

  AmitySocialClient.newCommentRepository()
      .createComment()
      .post(postId)
      .create()
      .text('Comment from Brian!')
      //mentionUsers to trigger push notifications
      .mentionUsers([userId])
      //metadata to render mention highlights
      .metadata(mentionMetadataCreator)
      .send()
      .then((AmityComment comment) => {
            //handle result
            //optional: to present the created comment in to the current replied comment collection
            //you will need manually put the newly created comment in to the collection
            //for example :
            _amityComments.add(comment)
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Parsing and Displaying Mentions

As we mentioned we provided the flexibility for you to define your own mention object data structure to represent mentions. You can use the default data structure provided by the SDK to render mentions in your application, which can be accessed through the helper class. This allows you to easily retrieve mentions and render them. The mentionable model contains properties related to the mentioned feature:

- `mentionUsers` - The AmityUser object array contains details about users mentioned in the current content.

- `metadata` - a free-form JSON object that can accommodate any information regarding the mentioned users. Our predefined structure for representing mentions is also in the metadata property.

Below is an example to render mentions in a comment by using our default mention data structure:

<CodeGroup>
```swift iOS
import AmitySDK

func createCommentWithMentionExample() {
    // 1. We will create a comment containing this text.
    let text = "Hi @john and @alice."
    // To add mention to a comment, we need extra steps.
    // In this example, we want to mention two users "john" and "alice".
    //
    // 2. We create metadata that contains mention object, via AmityMentionMapper helper class.
    //
    // Notice how `index` and `length` is set.
    let metadata = AmityMentionMapper.metadata(from: [
        AmityMention(type: .user, index: 3, length: 4, userId: "<john-user-id>"),
        AmityMention(type: .user, index: 13, length: 5, userId: "<alice-user-id>")
    ])
    // 3. We create mentionees.
    let mentionees = AmityMentioneesBuilder()
    mentionees.mentionUsers(userIds: ["<john-user-id>", "<alice-user-id>"])
    // Finally we pass (1) (2) and (3) to create a comment with mention.
    
    let createOptions = AmityCommentCreateOptions(referenceId: "post-id", referenceType: .post, text: text, parentId: nil, metadata: metadata, mentioneeBuilder: mentionees)
    commentRepository.createComment(with: createOptions) { comment, error in
        // Comment
    }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun createCommentWithMention(
    commentRepository: AmityCommentRepository,
    postId: String,
) {
    val userId = "userId"
    val startMentionIndex = 0
    val mentionLength = 6
    //create AmityMentionMetadata from userId, startIndex and length
    val mentionMetadata: AmityMentionMetadata =
        AmityMentionMetadata.USER(
            userId = userId,
            index = startMentionIndex,
            length = mentionLength
        )
    //construct AmityMentionMetadata to JsonObject using AmityMentionMetadataCreator
    val mentionMetadataCreator: JsonObject =
        AmityMentionMetadataCreator(mentionMetaData = listOf(mentionMetadata)).create()
    //create a comment with mention
    commentRepository.createComment()
        .post(postId) // or .content(contentId) for content type posts 9 .contentId(contentId)
        .with()
        .text("@userId Hello world!")
        //mentionUsers to trigger push notifications
        .mentionUsers(userIds = listOf(userId))
        //metadata to render mention highlights
        .metadata(mentionMetadataCreator)
        .build()
        .send()
        .doOnSuccess { comment: AmityComment ->
            //success
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CommentRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function createMentionComment(): Promise<Amity.Comment> {
  const newMentionComment = {
    data: {
      text: 'hello @userId1!',
    },
    referenceId: 'postId',
    referenceType: 'post' as Amity.CommentReferenceType,
    mentionees: [{ type: 'user', userIds: ['userId1'] }] as Amity.UserMention[],
  };

  const { data: comment } = await CommentRepository.createComment(newMentionComment);

  return comment;
}
```

```dart Flutter
//current parent comment collection
final _amityComments = <AmityComment>[];

//create comment to a post
void createComment(String postId) {
  const userId = 'userAId';
  const startMentionIndex = 0;
  const mentionLength = 6;
  //create AmityMentionMetadata from userId, startIndex and length
  final mentionMetadata = AmityUserMentionMetadata(
      userId: userId, index: startMentionIndex, length: mentionLength);
  //construct AmityMentionMetadata to JsonObject using AmityMentionMetadataCreator
  final mentionMetadataCreator =
      AmityMentionMetadataCreator([mentionMetadata]).create();

  AmitySocialClient.newCommentRepository()
      .createComment()
      .post(postId)
      .create()
      .text('Comment from Brian!')
      //mentionUsers to trigger push notifications
      .mentionUsers([userId])
      //metadata to render mention highlights
      .metadata(mentionMetadataCreator)
      .send()
      .then((AmityComment comment) => {
            //handle result
            //optional: to present the created comment in to the current replied comment collection
            //you will need manually put the newly created comment in to the collection
            //for example :
            _amityComments.add(comment)
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Mentions not triggering notifications" icon="bell-slash">
**Common causes:**
- Missing `mentionUsers` array in the parameter
- Invalid user IDs in the mention list
- User has disabled mention notifications
- Network connectivity issues

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mention highlighting not working" icon="highlighter">
**Common causes:**
- Incorrect mention positions in metadata
- Missing mention parsing in UI components
- CSS styling issues
- Metadata not matching actual text

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance issues with mention input" icon="clock">
**Common causes:**
- No debouncing on search queries
- Loading too many user suggestions
- Inefficient mention parsing
- Memory leaks in component state

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Implement debounced search
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const debouncedSearch = debounce((query: string) => {
  searchUsers(query).then(setSuggestions);
}, 300);

// Limit results
const limitedSuggestions = suggestions.slice(0, 10);
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mention data inconsistency" icon="triangle-exclamation">
**Common causes:**
- Text modifications after mention creation
- Incorrect index calculations
- Unicode character handling issues
- Concurrent text editing

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Always validate before submission
const validateMentionData = (text: string, mentions: AmityMention[]) => {
  for (const mention of mentions) {
    const start = mention.index;
    const end = start + mention.length + 1;
    const mentionText = text.substring(start, end);
    
    if (!mentionText.startsWith('@')) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid mention at position ${start}`);
    }
  }
  return true;
};
