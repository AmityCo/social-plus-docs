# Poll

The Social Plus SDK encompasses comprehensive support for polls, offering developers an effortless way to incorporate polls into their social applications. Polls enable users to create and participate in a diverse range of topics, sparking targeted engagement and conversations among users.

To integrate poll functionality, developers can utilize the poll features offered by the Social Plus SDK in their applications. Polls can be tailored to meet specific needs, including options for single or multiple-choice polls, setting poll expiration dates, and more. Users can then participate in the poll by choosing their preferred option. At present, the Social Plus SDK only supports the integration of polls within posts, please refer to - [#create-poll-post](../social/posts/create-post/poll-post.md#create-poll-post "mention"), [#poll-post](../social/posts/viewing-post-content.md#poll-post "mention").&#x20;

## Create Poll&#x20;

&#x20;As demonstrated in the code sample below, here's a way to create a poll in the poll post.

Polls can be created with the following settable controls:

* `question`  - A question that can be up to 500 characters long.
* `answer` - A set of two to ten answers. Each answer can be up to 200 characters long.
* `answerType` - Indicates whether the survey allows multiple choices. The available options are `Single` (default) and `Multiple`.
* `timeToClosePoll` - A time window limiting how long the poll will be open. By default, the `setTimeToClosePoll` value is set to 30 days if no value has been set for it.&#x20;
