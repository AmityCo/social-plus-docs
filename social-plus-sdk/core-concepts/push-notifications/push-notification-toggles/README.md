# Push Notification Toggles

The SDK has three levels of notifications and in order for it to be sent, a notification has to pass throughout all three levels.

* **Network Level:** (via Admin Panel) turning off notifications at this level effectively disables push notifications altogether for all of your customers.
* **User Level:** (via client) A user can choose to enable/disable notifications per feature module. Please note that this setting is per user, not per device: regardless of which device sets this toggle, the new preference will take effect in all the devices where the user is logged in.
* **Channel or Community Level:** (via the client) A user can choose to enable/disable notifications per channel or community (where is a member). Again, this preference is per user, not per device.

<Info>
In addition to push notifications, we also offer a [Notification Tray](broken-reference) that stores the notification history for each user.
