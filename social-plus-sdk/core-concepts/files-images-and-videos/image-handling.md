## Upload Images

To upload an image to the system, you can use the Social Plus Image Upload API provided by the SDK. The API allows you to upload an image to the Social Plus server/ The SDK simplifies the process of uploading images by providing pre-built components that you can easily integrate into your application. Additionally, you can add alt text to your images to support accessibility, ensuring that your application is more inclusive for all users.

## Retrieve Images

You can retrieve an image from Social Plus using the Social Plus Image Retrieval API provided by the SDK. The API enables you to retrieve an image from the Social Plus server by supplying the image URL. Once an image is uploaded to the server, the image will be automatically transformed into four different sizes for versatile usage. We provided an option to retrieve a specific image size which are:

* **Small**: is used for image thumbnails, with a maximum image size of 160 pixels per dimension. For example, this should be used for small previews in an image gallery that displays a large number of images in a grid.
* **Medium**: is used for standard image display, with a maximum image size of 600 pixels per dimension.
* **Large**: is used for full-screen image display, with a maximum image size of 1500 pixels per dimension.
