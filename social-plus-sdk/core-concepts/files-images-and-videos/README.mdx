# Files, Images, and Videos

Enable rich media sharing in your Social+ application with comprehensive file upload, download, and management capabilities.

<Info>
**Caching Recommendation**: The SDK doesn't handle file caching automatically. Implement your own caching strategy or use established libraries for optimal performance.

## Integration Guides

Our file handling system is organized into specialized areas:

### [General File Handling](./file)
Learn the fundamentals of uploading, downloading, and managing files of any type. This covers the core SDK methods that work with all supported file formats.

**Key Topics:**
- File upload with progress tracking
- Download management and caching
- File metadata and properties
- Error handling and retry logic

### [Image Processing](./image-handling)
Specialized functionality for image files, including resizing, format conversion, and thumbnail generation.

**Key Topics:**
- Image upload and optimization
- Thumbnail and preview generation
- Format conversion and compression
- Image metadata extraction

### [Video Management](./video-handling)
Advanced video handling features including streaming, transcoding, and adaptive quality delivery.

**Key Topics:**
- Video upload and processing
- Streaming and playback optimization
- Thumbnail and preview generation
- Quality adaptive streaming

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    **Implement Caching**: Use libraries like SDWebImage (iOS), Glide (Android), or react-native-fast-image for efficient image caching.
    
    ```typescript
    // Example: Image caching strategy
    const getCachedImage = async (url: string): Promise<string> => {
        const cached = await cacheManager.get(url);
        return cached || await downloadAndCache(url);
    };
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User Experience">
    **Progressive Loading**: Show placeholders and loading states while files are processing.
    
    ```typescript
    // Show loading state during upload
    const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState(0);
    
    const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
        await uploadFile(file, {
            onProgress: (progress) => setUploadProgress(progress)
        });
    };
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    **Graceful Failures**: Handle network issues, file size limits, and format restrictions gracefully.
    
    ```typescript
    try {
        await uploadFile(file);
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.code === 'FILE_TOO_LARGE') {
            showError('File is too large. Maximum size is 100MB.');
        } else if (error.code === 'UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT') {
            showError('This file type is not supported.');
        }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security Considerations">
    **Validate Files**: Always validate file types and sizes both client-side and server-side.
    
    ```typescript
    const validateFile = (file: File): boolean => {
        const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'video/mp4'];
        const maxSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB
        
        return allowedTypes.includes(file.type) && file.size <= maxSize;
    };
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Use Cases

<Tip>
**Performance Tip**: Always implement progressive image loading and use appropriate image sizes for different contexts (thumbnails, previews, full resolution) to optimize bandwidth and user experience.
