# Files, Images, and Videos

File upload and download are key features of our product, which enable developers to easily incorporate file-sharing functionality into their applications. With support for a wide range of file types, including images, videos, audio, and documents, developers can create highly engaging and interactive user experiences that drive engagement and increase retention.

By enabling users to share files directly within the chat or social feed, developers can create highly personalized and engaging experiences that foster deeper connections among users. For example, users can share photos and videos with friends and family, or exchange documents and other files within a community. To support various use cases and make it easy to handle files, images, and videos, we offer convenient methods for managing these types of content:

* [file.md](file.md "mention")
* [image-handling.md](image-handling.md "mention")
* [video-handling.md](video-handling.md "mention")

<Info>
The SDK does not manage the caching of any images or files. It is recommended to effectively handle caching to ensure optimal performance. You can use a pre-existing implementation or library to handle the caching of files or images.
