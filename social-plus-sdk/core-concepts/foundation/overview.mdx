## Getting Started

1. Start with [Core Concepts](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/foundation/core-concept) to understand the SDK architecture
2. Learn about [Session Management](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/foundation/session-state) for state handling
3. Implement proper [Error Handling](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/foundation/error-handling) patterns
4. Set up [Logging](/social-plus-sdk/core-concepts/foundation/logging) for better debugging

These foundation concepts will prepare you for implementing more advanced features like real-time communication, user management, and content handling.
