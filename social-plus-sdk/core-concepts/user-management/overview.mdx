## How social.plus User Management Works

<Info>
**Decentralized Approach**: social.plus SDK does not store or manage personal user data. Instead, users are represented by unique identifiers that you control.
</Info>

### Key Principles

<Steps>
<Step title="Your Data, Your Control">
social.plus doesn't store user profiles, emails, or personal information. You maintain full control over your user data in your own systems.
</Step>

<Step title="Unique User Identifiers">
Every user is represented by a unique `userId` - typically your database primary key or another immutable identifier.
</Step>

<Step title="Role-Based Permissions">
Assign roles and permissions through your admin panel, giving users different privileges and access levels.
</Step>

<Step title="Query & Search Capabilities">
Use social.plus repositories to query user information and perform searches across your user base.
</Step>
</Steps>
