title: "Delete User"
description: "Learn how to permanently delete users and their associated data from Social+ SDK"
---

## Overview

The Delete User API permanently removes users from the system. This is a powerful administrative function that should be used with extreme caution, as all data associated with the user will be permanently lost.

<Danger>
This action performs a **hard delete** and **all deleted data will be lost permanently and cannot be recovered**. Use this feature only when absolutely necessary.
</Danger>

## Admin-Only Feature

<Info>
User deletion can only be performed by **admin users** through the API or Console. Regular users cannot delete other users or themselves through the SDK.
</Info>

## Deletion Options

Configure what data gets deleted along with the user account:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Profile Data" icon="user">
    User profile, photos, images, and files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Data" icon="messages">
    Messages, channels, posts, and comments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Deletion Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `deleteAll` | Delete all personal data | Removes profile, photos, images, and files |
| `markMessageDeleted` | Delete message data | Removes all message channels and messages |
| `hardDeletePost` | Delete post data | Removes posts, comments, reactions, and child content |
| `hardDeleteComment` | Delete comment data | Removes all comments and reactions |

## What Happens When a User is Deleted?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account Status">
    - **User cannot be reactivated**: Once deleted, the account cannot be restored under any circumstances
    - **System ID preserved**: The user's system ID remains in the database for referential integrity
    - **Display name changed**: Username is replaced with "Deleted User" to protect identity
    - **Account marked as deleted**: All queries will show the user as deleted
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content & Data">
    - **Personal data removed**: Profile, photos, videos, images, and files are permanently deleted
    - **Messages deleted**: All conversation channels and messages created by the user are removed
    - **Posts and comments**: All posts, comments, and associated content are marked as deleted
    - **File attachments**: All uploaded files and attachments are permanently removed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Community Impact">
    - **Channel membership updated**: User is removed from all channels and member counts are updated
    - **Reaction counts updated**: All reactions by the deleted user are removed and counts updated
    - **Conversation channels deleted**: All channels created by the user are permanently removed
    - **No access restoration**: No other user can reactivate or access the deleted account
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation

<Note>
User deletion is typically performed through the Admin Console or server-side API calls, not directly through client SDKs for security reasons.
</Note>

### API Usage Example

  <Tab title="iOS">
    ```swift
    // Note: This operation requires admin privileges
    // Typically called from server-side or admin dashboard
    
    let adminClient = AmityClient.shared // Must be authenticated as admin
    
    adminClient.userRepository.deleteUser(
        userId: "user123",
        deleteAll: true,
        markMessageDeleted: true,
        hardDeletePost: true,
        hardDeleteComment: true
    ) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success:
            print("User deleted successfully")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Failed to delete user: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }

  <Tab title="Android">

    val userRepository = AmityUserRepository(adminClient)
    
    userRepository.deleteUser(
        userId = "user123",
        deleteAll = true,
        markMessageDeleted = true,

      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer admin-token'

        userId: 'user123',
        deleteAll: true,
        markMessageDeleted: true,
        hardDeletePost: true,

      print('User deleted successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      print('Failed to delete user: $error');
    }
    ```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Before Deletion">
    - **Confirm admin privileges**: Ensure the requesting user has proper permissions
    - **Backup critical data**: Export any data that might be needed later
    - **User notification**: Inform the user before deletion if applicable
    - **Legal compliance**: Follow GDPR and other data protection regulations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deletion Process">
    - **Use appropriate flags**: Choose deletion parameters based on your requirements
    - **Monitor progress**: Large deletions may take time to complete
    - **Log activities**: Keep audit logs for administrative actions
    - **Handle errors**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="After Deletion">
    - **Verify completion**: Confirm all selected data has been removed
    - **Update UI**: Remove deleted users from any cached lists or displays
    - **Clean up references**: Update any app-specific references to the deleted user
    - **Audit compliance**: Ensure deletion meets regulatory requirements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

Common errors and their meanings:

```typescript
// Example error handling for admin operations
try {
  await deleteUser(userId, options);
} catch (error) {
  switch (error.code) {
    case 'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS':
      // User lacks admin privileges
      break;
    case 'USER_NOT_FOUND':
      // User ID doesn't exist
      break;
    case 'DELETION_IN_PROGRESS':
      // User deletion already in progress
      break;
    case 'DELETION_FAILED':
      // Technical error during deletion
      break;
    default:
      // Handle other errors
      break;
  }
}
```
