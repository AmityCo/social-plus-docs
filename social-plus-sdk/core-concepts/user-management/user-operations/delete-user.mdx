title: "Delete User"
description: "Learn how to permanently delete users and their associated data from social.plus SDK"
---

The Delete User API permanently removes users from the system. This is a powerful administrative function that should be used with extreme caution, as all data associated with the user will be permanently lost.

<Danger>
This action performs a **hard delete** and **all deleted data will be lost permanently and cannot be recovered**. Use this feature only when absolutely necessary.
</Danger>

## Admin-Only Feature

<Info>
User deletion can only be performed by **admin users** through the API or Console. Regular users cannot delete other users or themselves through the SDK.
</Info>

## API Parameters

The delete user operation accepts the following parameters to control what data gets deleted:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `userId` | string | Yes | The unique identifier of the user to delete |
| `deleteAll` | boolean | No | Delete all personal data including profile, images, files, messages, posts, and comments |
| `markMessageDeleted` | boolean | No | Delete all message channels and messages created by the user |
| `hardDeletePost` | boolean | No | Delete posts, comments, reactions, and child content |
| `hardDeleteComment` | boolean | No | Delete all comments and reactions made by the user |

    - **Display name changed**: Username is replaced with "Deleted User" to protect identity
    - **Account marked as deleted**: All queries will show the user as deleted
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation

<Note>
User deletion is typically performed through the Admin Console or server-side API calls, not directly through client SDKs for security reasons. Refer to the API Reference introduction for endpoint availability.
</Note>


## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Before Deletion">
    - **Verify admin permissions**: Always check that the requesting user has admin privileges
    - **User confirmation**: Implement confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions
    - **Data backup**: Export critical user data if needed for compliance or business purposes
    - **Notification**: Inform the user about the deletion if applicable and legally required
    - **Audit logging**: Log all deletion requests for security and compliance tracking
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="During Deletion">
    - **Progress tracking**: For bulk operations, implement progress indicators
    - **Error resilience**: Handle network failures and retry logic appropriately
    - **Rate limiting**: Don't overwhelm the server with too many concurrent deletions
    - **Transaction safety**: Ensure deletion operations are atomic where possible
    - **Resource cleanup**: Monitor server resources during large deletion operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="After Deletion">
    - **Verification**: Confirm all selected data has been properly removed
    - **Cache invalidation**: Clear any cached user data in your application
    - **UI updates**: Remove deleted users from all relevant displays and lists
    - **Reference cleanup**: Update any application-specific references to deleted users
    - **Compliance documentation**: Maintain records for regulatory compliance (GDPR, etc.)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Considerations

<Tip>
**Batch Processing**: When deleting multiple users, process them in small batches (5-10 users) to avoid overwhelming the server and ensure better error handling.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Large Datasets**: Users with extensive content (thousands of posts, messages, or files) may take longer to delete. Consider implementing progress indicators for better user experience.
</Warning>

## Alternative Approaches

Consider these alternatives before permanent deletion:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User Suspension" icon="pause">
    Temporarily ban user access without data loss. Users can be unbanned later if needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Moderation" icon="shield">
    Remove problematic content while preserving the user account and other data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Compliance & Legal Considerations

<Info>
When implementing user deletion, ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
