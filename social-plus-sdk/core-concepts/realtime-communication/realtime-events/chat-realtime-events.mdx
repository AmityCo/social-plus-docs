Chat real-time events enable live updates for messaging features through topic subscriptions. A topic is a unique path constructed for each model you wish to receive real-time updates about, with helper methods provided for each model type.

<Info>
For conversation and community channels, real-time events are automatic for channel members. However, live channels still need to be established. To receive updates from a channel, users must have 'Member' status. Leaving a channel automatically stops event delivery.

## Subchannel Topic

Subscribe to subchannel events for real-time messaging updates:

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
// Create Topic
let topic = AmitySubChannelTopic(subChannel: subChannel)

// Subscribe to it
let topicSubscription = AmityTopicSubscription(client: client)
topicSubscription.subscribeTopic(topic) { success, error in
    // Handle subscription result
}

// Unsubscribe it
topicSubscription.unsubscribeTopic(topic) { success, error in
    // Handle unsubscription result
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun subscribeSubChannel(subChannel: AmitySubChannel) {
    // Subscribe to subchannel
    subChannel
        .subscription()
        .subscribeTopic()
        .doOnComplete {
            // Success
        }
        .subscribe()
        
    // Unsubscribe from subchannel
    subChannel
        .subscription()
        .unsubscribeTopic()
        .doOnComplete {
            // Success
        }
        .subscribe()
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { getSubChannelTopic, subscribeTopic } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

const topic = getSubChannelTopic(subChannel);

const unsubscribe = subscribeTopic(topic);

// Unsubscribe when done
unsubscribe();
```
