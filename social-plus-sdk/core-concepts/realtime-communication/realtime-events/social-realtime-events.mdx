Social real-time events enable live updates for social features through topic subscriptions. A topic is a distinct path constructed for each model you wish to subscribe to, with helper methods provided for each model type.

<Info>
To subscribe to updates from a community or its content, users must have 'Member' status. Leaving a community automatically stops event delivery.
