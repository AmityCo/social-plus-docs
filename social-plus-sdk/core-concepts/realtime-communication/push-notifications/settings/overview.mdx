## Settings Hierarchy

Understanding the notification settings hierarchy is crucial for proper implementation:

1. **Community Level**: Global policies and restrictions
2. **Channel Level**: Channel-specific rules and preferences
3. **User Level**: Personal preferences and overrides

User settings typically have the highest priority, unless restricted by community or channel policies.

## Key Features

- **Granular Control**: Fine-grained notification preferences
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent default settings based on user behavior
- **Bulk Management**: Efficient settings management for administrators
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant application of setting changes
- **Compliance**: Privacy and regulation compliance features

## Best Practices

- Provide clear, user-friendly setting descriptions
- Implement smart defaults to reduce configuration burden
- Respect user privacy and consent preferences
- Test notification delivery across different settings combinations
- Monitor settings usage and optimize based on user behavior
