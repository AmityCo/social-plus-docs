# Channel Notification Settings

Control notification preferences for specific channels, allowing users to customize their notification experience on a per-channel basis while maintaining global settings.

## Overview

Channel-level settings override user-level defaults for specific channels. Users can mute busy channels, enable notifications for important conversations, or customize notification behavior based on channel context.

## Get Channel Settings

```typescript
const channelSettings = await channelNotification.getSettings(channelId);
```

## Update Channel Settings

```typescript
await channelNotification.updateSettings(channelId, {
  enabled: true,
  mentions: true,
  reactions: false
});
```

## Settings Options

- **Messages** - New message notifications
- **Mentions** - When user is mentioned
- **Reactions** - Message reactions and emoji responses
- **Member Activities** - User joins/leaves
- **Channel Updates** - Name, description, or settings changes
