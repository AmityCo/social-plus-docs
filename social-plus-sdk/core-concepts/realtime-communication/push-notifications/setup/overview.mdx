## Setup Process

Each platform requires specific configuration steps:

### Common Steps
1. **SDK Integration**: Install and configure the Social Plus SDK
2. **Platform Registration**: Register your app with platform-specific services
3. **Certificate/Key Setup**: Configure authentication credentials
4. **Testing**: Verify notification delivery and functionality

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### iOS (APNs)
- Apple Developer Account and certificates
- Push notification capability in Xcode project
- Provisioning profile configuration

#### Android (FCM)
- Firebase project setup and configuration
- Google Services JSON file integration
- Proper permissions and service configuration

#### React Native
- Platform-specific native modules
- Bridge configuration for iOS and Android
- Unified JavaScript API implementation

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage of authentication keys and certificates
- Proper certificate rotation and renewal procedures
- Network security and encrypted communication
- User permission handling and consent management

## Testing & Validation

- **Development Testing**: Local testing with development certificates
- **Staging Environment**: Production-like testing environment
- **Production Deployment**: Live environment validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Delivery rates and error tracking

## Troubleshooting

Common setup issues and solutions:
- Certificate and key validation problems
- Network connectivity and firewall issues
- Platform-specific permission and configuration errors
- Integration and compatibility challenges

Choose your platform to get started with the specific setup process that matches your development environment.
