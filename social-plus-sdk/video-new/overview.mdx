# Video SDK

Social Plus Video SDK enables you to integrate professional live-streaming capabilities into your applications across multiple platforms. Build engaging video experiences with low-latency streaming, high-quality playback, and comprehensive moderation tools.

## Key Features

- **Professional Live Streaming**: Low-latency streaming capabilities up to 4 hours
- **Cross-Platform Support**: SDKs available for Android, iOS, Web, React Native, Flutter, and TypeScript React Native
- **High-Quality Video**: Support for multiple resolutions (480p, 720p, 1080p) with adaptive bitrates
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Handle high-volume concurrent viewers without maintaining your own infrastructure
- **Recorded Playback**: Automatic provision of playback videos when streaming ends
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive notifications when streams start, end, or encounter issues
- **Parallel Streaming**: Manage and run multiple live streams simultaneously
- **Moderation Tools**: Comprehensive stream management and moderation via admin panel
- **16:9 Aspect Ratio**: Optimized for modern mobile and web viewing experiences
