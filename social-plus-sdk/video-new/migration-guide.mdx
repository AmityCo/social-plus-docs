## Migration Overview

The migration from Stream to Room is straightforward, with most changes being simple terminology updates. The new Room system maintains functional parity with the legacy Stream system while adding new capabilities.

### Terminology Changes

| Legacy (Stream)         | New (Room)            | Description                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `AmityStream`           | `AmityRoom`           | The main livestream entity          |
| `AmityStreamRepository` | `AmityRoomRepository` | Repository for stream operations    |
| `streamId`              | `roomId`              | Unique identifier for the stream    |
| `dataType: 'stream'`    | `dataType: 'room'`    | Post data type for livestream posts |

## SDK Migration

### Repository Changes

Replace Stream repository calls with Room repository equivalents:

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
// Legacy Stream
let streamRepository = AmityStreamRepository(client: client)
let stream = try await streamRepository.getStream(streamId: "stream-123")

// New Room
let roomRepository = AmityRoomRepository(client: client)
let room = try await roomRepository.getRoom(roomId: "room-123")
```


```kotlin Android
// Legacy Stream
val streamRepository = AmityStreamRepository(client)
streamRepository.getStream(streamId = "stream-123")
    .subscribe { stream -> /* handle stream */ }

// New Room
val roomRepository = AmityRoomRepository(client)
roomRepository.getRoom(roomId = "room-123")
    .subscribe { room -> /* handle room */ }
```


```typescript TypeScript
// Legacy Stream
import { StreamRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';
const stream = await StreamRepository.getStream('stream-123');

// New Room
import { RoomRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';
const room = await RoomRepository.getRoom('room-123');
```

</CodeGroup>

### Creating Livestream Posts

When creating posts with livestream content, use `roomId` instead of `streamId`:

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
// Legacy Stream Post
let post = try await postRepository.createLivestreamPost(
    targetType: .community,
    targetId: communityId,
)

// New Room Post
let post = try await postRepository.createRoomPost(
    targetType: .community,
    targetId: communityId,
)
```


```kotlin Android
// Legacy Stream Post
postRepository.createLivestreamPost(
    targetType = AmityPost.TargetType.COMMUNITY,
    targetId = communityId,
    ...
)

// New Room Post
postRepository.createRoomPost(
    targetType = AmityPost.TargetType.COMMUNITY,
    targetId = communityId,
    ...
)
```


```typescript TypeScript
// Legacy Stream Post
await PostRepository.createLivestreamPost({
    targetType: 'community',
    targetId: communityId,
    ...
});

// New Room Post
await PostRepository.createRoomPost({
    targetType: 'community',
    targetId: communityId,
    ...
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Entity Property Mapping

Most properties map directly with name changes:

| Legacy Stream Property | New Room Property  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| `stream.streamId`      | `room.roomId`      |
| `stream.title`         | `room.title`       |
| `stream.description`   | `room.description` |
| `stream.status`        | `room.status`      |

### New Room-Only Features

The Room system introduces new capabilities not available in the legacy Stream. These features are ready to use once you migrate:

| Feature                | Description                                                                | Documentation                                                               |
