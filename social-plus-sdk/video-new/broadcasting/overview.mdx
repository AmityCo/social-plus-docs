# Broadcasting Overview

The Social+ Video SDK provides comprehensive broadcasting capabilities that enable you to create engaging live streaming experiences across all platforms.

## What is Broadcasting?

Broadcasting allows users to share their live video content with viewers in real-time. The Social+ SDK handles the complex aspects of video encoding, streaming protocols, and delivery optimization.

## Key Features

### Real-time Streaming
- Low-latency live video transmission
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- Automatic quality adjustment based on network conditions

### Multi-platform Support
- Native iOS broadcasting
- Native Android broadcasting
- Web-based broadcasting
- React Native integration
- Flutter integration

### Advanced Broadcasting Features
- **Camera Controls**: Switch between front/rear cameras, adjust zoom, focus, and exposure
- **Audio Management**: Microphone controls, noise suppression, and audio mixing
- **Screen Sharing**: Share device screen alongside camera feed
- **Multi-streaming**: Broadcast to multiple platforms simultaneously

## Getting Started

### Basic Broadcasting Setup

```javascript
import { SocialPlusVideo } from '@social-plus/video-sdk';

const broadcaster = new SocialPlusVideo({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  mode: 'broadcaster'
});

// Start broadcasting
await broadcaster.startBroadcast({
  title: 'My Live Stream',
  description: 'Broadcasting live from the event',
  privacy: 'public'
});
```

### Broadcasting Flow

1. **Initialize SDK**: Set up the broadcasting client
2. **Configure Stream**: Set stream parameters (resolution, bitrate, etc.)
3. **Preview Setup**: Show camera preview to broadcaster
4. **Start Broadcasting**: Begin live transmission
5. **Monitor Stream**: Track viewer count, quality metrics
6. **End Broadcasting**: Gracefully stop the stream

## Broadcasting States

The SDK manages several broadcasting states:

- **Idle**: Ready to start broadcasting
- **Preparing**: Setting up camera and audio
- **Preview**: Showing camera preview
- **Broadcasting**: Actively streaming
- **Paused**: Temporarily paused
- **Stopped**: Broadcast ended
- **Error**: Something went wrong

## Quality Management

### Adaptive Streaming
The SDK automatically adjusts stream quality based on:
- Network bandwidth
- Device capabilities
- Viewer feedback
- Server load

### Manual Quality Control
Broadcasters can also manually control:
- Video resolution (480p, 720p, 1080p)
- Frame rate (15fps, 30fps, 60fps)
- Bitrate limits
- Audio quality settings

## Platform Considerations

### iOS Broadcasting
- Uses AVFoundation for camera access
- Background broadcasting support
- Picture-in-picture mode
- Screen recording integration

### Android Broadcasting
- Camera2 API integration
- Service-based background broadcasting
- Multi-window support
- Hardware encoder optimization

### Web Broadcasting
- WebRTC-based streaming
- MediaDevices API for camera access
- Screen sharing capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility
