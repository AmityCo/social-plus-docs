# Broadcasting Overview

The Social Plus Video SDK provides comprehensive room-based broadcasting capabilities that enable interactive live streaming with co-hosting support across all platforms.

## What is Room Broadcasting?

Room broadcasting enables collaborative live streaming where multiple hosts can broadcast together using LiveKit infrastructure. Unlike traditional single-host livestreams, rooms support real-time co-streaming, viewer interaction through live chat, and comprehensive moderation controls.

## Broadcasting Workflow

### 1. Create Room
Set up a room with title, description, and optional configuration.

### 2. Create Room Post
Link the room to a post for social distribution in feeds or communities.

### 3. Get Broadcaster Data
Retrieve LiveKit credentials (`coHostToken`, `coHostUrl`) for streaming.

### 4. Connect to LiveKit
Use the LiveKit SDK to establish the streaming connection.

### 5. Start Broadcasting
Enable camera and microphone to begin the live broadcast.

### 6. Manage Broadcast
Invite co-hosts, monitor connection, interact with viewers.

### 7. End Broadcast
Disconnect from LiveKit and stop the room.

## Platform Support

| **iOS** | ✅ Full Support | AVFoundation + LiveKit SDK |
| **Android** | ✅ Full Support | Camera2 API + LiveKit SDK |
| **TypeScript/Web** | ✅ Full Support | WebRTC + LiveKit SDK |

## Broadcasting Architecture

The room broadcasting system uses LiveKit for real-time video streaming:

- **Host** creates the room and gets broadcaster credentials
- **Co-Hosts** are invited and receive their own credentials
- **Viewers** watch via HLS playback URL (no LiveKit connection needed)
- **Live Chat** runs through integrated chat channels

  <Step title="Create a Room Post">
    Create a post linked to the room for visibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Broadcaster Data">
    Call `getBroadcastData()` to get LiveKit credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect & Broadcast">
    Use LiveKit SDK to connect and publish video/audio tracks
