## Governance Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel Roles & Permissions" icon="shield-halved">
    **Understanding role-based access control**
    
    Channel roles define varying levels of access and permissions within chat channels:
    - **Channel Creator**: Automatically assigned as moderator with full permissions
    - **Moderators**: Can manage members, assign roles, and moderate content
    - **Members**: Standard participants with message and interaction permissions
    - **Custom Roles**: Application-defined roles with specific permission sets
    
    Role assignments determine what actions users can perform within channels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Moderation Hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
    **Understanding moderation authority levels**
    
    Channel governance follows a clear hierarchy:
    - **Channel Creator**: Cannot be removed and has ultimate authority
    - **Moderators**: Can promote/demote other users and manage channel activities
    - **Regular Members**: Limited to standard channel participation
    
    Moderators cannot remove other moderators of equal or higher standing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Channel Type Considerations" icon="layer-group">
    **Governance features by channel type**
    
    Different channel types support different governance features:
    - **Community Channels**: Full governance features including roles, banning, muting
    - **Live Channels**: Complete moderation capabilities for real-time interactions
    - **Conversation Channels**: Limited governance, primarily member management
    - **Broadcast Channels**: Restricted moderation due to one-way communication
    
    Choose appropriate channel types based on your moderation needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Moderation Best Practices" icon="thumbs-up">
    **Effective channel governance strategies**
    
    Implement governance effectively:
    - **Clear Guidelines**: Establish and communicate channel rules
    - **Graduated Responses**: Use muting before banning for minor infractions
    - **Consistent Enforcement**: Apply rules fairly across all members
    - **Regular Review**: Periodically review bans and mutes for appropriateness
    - **Moderator Training**: Ensure moderators understand their responsibilities
    
    Well-implemented governance creates positive community experiences.
