## Membership Concepts

Understanding channel membership is crucial for effective member management:

| Concept | Description | Capabilities |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Channel Members** | Users with access to the channel | Can view messages, participate in conversations |
| **Channel Creators** | Users who created the channel | Full administrative control, cannot be removed |
| **Access Control** | Permissions for joining/leaving | Defines channel privacy and access rules |

<Note>
**Membership Rules**:
- Channel creators cannot be removed from their own channels
- Some channel types may have automatic membership rules
- Member limits may apply based on your subscription plan
</Note>

## Implementation Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Members">
    **Add users to channel membership**
    
    Invite users to join channels, enabling them to participate in conversations and access channel content.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `addMembers` | Add users to channel | Inviting new participants |
    | `inviteUsers` | Send invitations | Formal invitation process |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
   // Add 'user1' and 'user2' to this channel
do {
    let success = try await channelMembership.addMembers(["user1", "user2"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    //Add members
    channelRepository
        .membership(channelId = "channelId")
        .addMembers(userIds = listOf("userId1, userId2"))
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function addChannelMembers() {
  const didAdd = await ChannelRepository.Membership.addMembers('channelId', ['userId1', 'userId2']);

  return didAdd;
}

    ```
</CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    **Best Practice**: Always validate user eligibility before adding members. Consider implementing confirmation flows for bulk member additions and provide clear feedback on success/failure states.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remove Members">
    **Remove users from channel membership**
    
    Remove users from channels when they should no longer have access, helping maintain channel security and relevance.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `removeMembers` | Remove users from channel | Revoking channel access |
    | `leaveChannel` | User leaves voluntarily | Self-removal from channel |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    // Remove 'user3' from this channel
do {
    let success = try await channelMembership.removeMembers(["user3"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    //Remove members
    channelRepository
        .membership(channelId = "channelId")
        .removeMembers(userIds = listOf("userId1, userId2"))
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function addChannelMembers() {
  const didAdd = await ChannelRepository.Membership.addMembers('channelId', ['userId1', 'userId2']);

  return didAdd;
}

async function removeChannelMembers() {
  const didRemove = await ChannelRepository.Membership.removeMembers('channelId', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  return didRemove;
}
    ```

    <Warning>
    **Removal Restrictions**: Channel creators cannot be removed from their channels. Always validate removal permissions before attempting to remove members.
