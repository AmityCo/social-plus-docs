description: "Ban and unban channel members to restrict access for users who violate community guidelines."

<Info>
**Key Benefit**: Enforce community guidelines by restricting access for users who violate rules, while maintaining the ability to reinstate users when appropriate.
</Info>

## Feature Overview

Ban Management provides the tools to restrict channel access for users who violate community guidelines or engage in disruptive behavior. Banned users lose access to the channel and cannot rejoin without being unbanned by a moderator.

  <Card title="Ban Members" icon="user-slash">
    **Restrict channel access**
    - Remove disruptive users
    - Enforce community guidelines
    - Prevent rejoining
    - Maintain channel safety
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unban Members" icon="user-check">
    **Restore channel access**
    - Reinstate reformed users
    - Correct mistaken bans
    - Enable second chances
    - Manage user rehabilitation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Permanent Impact**: Banned users cannot rejoin the channel until explicitly unbanned. Use ban functionality responsibly and consider temporary alternatives like muting for less severe violations.
</Warning>

## Ban System Concepts

Understanding the ban system is essential for effective moderation:

| Concept | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Channel Ban** | User blocked from specific channel | Cannot access channel content or participate |
| **Ban Status** | Current restriction state | Active ban prevents all channel interactions |
| **Moderation Rights** | Permission to ban/unban | Only moderators can manage bans |
| **Ban History** | Record of banning actions | Audit trail for moderation decisions |

<Note>
**Important Considerations**:
- Banned users are automatically removed from the channel
- Bans persist until explicitly lifted by a moderator
- Channel creators cannot be banned from their own channels
- Consider documenting ban reasons for consistency
</Note>

## Implementation Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ban Members">
    **Restrict channel access for problematic users**
    
    Remove users from channels and prevent them from rejoining when they violate community guidelines or engage in disruptive behavior.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `banMembers` | Ban users from channel | Removing disruptive members |
    | `getBannedMembers` | List banned users | Reviewing ban status |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
   let channelModeration = AmityChannelModeration(client: client, andChannel: "<channel-id>")

// Ban channel members
do {
    let success = try await channelModeration.banMembers(["<user-id>"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
   // ban channel members
    val userIds = listOf("user1", "user2")
    channelRepository.moderation(channelId = channel.getChannelId())
        .banMembers(userIds = userIds)
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
  import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function banChannelMembers() {
  const didBan = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.banMembers('channelId', ['userId1', 'userId2']);

  return didBan;
}
    ```
 </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>
    **Ban Validation**: Always validate that the current user has moderation permissions and that the target user can be banned (not channel creator) before attempting ban operations.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unban Members">
    **Restore channel access for banned users**
    
    Reinstate users who have been banned, allowing them to rejoin the channel and participate in conversations again.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `unbanMembers` | Remove ban restrictions | Reinstating users |
    | `getBannedMembers` | View banned user list | Managing ban status |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
   let channelModeration = AmityChannelModeration(client: client, andChannel: "<channel-id>")

// Unban channel members
do {
    let success = try await channelModeration.unbanMembers(["<user-id>"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    // unban channel members
    channelRepository.moderation(channelId = channel.getChannelId())
        .unbanMembers(userIds = userIds)
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function unbanChannelMembers() {
  const didUnban = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.unbanMembers('channelId', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  return didUnban;
}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    **Unban Verification**: Always verify that a user is actually banned before attempting to unban them. Consider implementing notifications to inform unbanned users of their restored access.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ban Policy Guidelines" icon="gavel">
    **Establishing clear ban policies**
    
    - Define clear community guidelines and ban criteria
    - Establish escalation procedures (warning → mute → ban → remove)
    - Implement appeals processes for disputed bans
    - Train moderators on appropriate ban usage and escalation
    
    Clear policies ensure fair and consistent moderation across your community.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Moderation Workflow" icon="arrow-progress">
    **Efficient ban management processes**
    
    - Use confirmation dialogs for ban actions to prevent mistakes
    - Implement reason codes for standardized ban documentation
    - Monitor ban patterns to identify potential abuse or trends
    - Regular review of banned users for potential reinstatement
    - Maintain communication with banned users about appeals
    
    Structured workflows improve moderation quality and user trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Communication" icon="comments">
    **Transparent communication about bans**
    
    - Notify users clearly about ban reasons and duration
    - Provide information about appeals processes
    - Use constructive language that promotes improvement
    - Offer guidelines for rejoining the community
    - Document all communications for future reference
    
    Clear communication helps users understand and potentially address their behavior.
