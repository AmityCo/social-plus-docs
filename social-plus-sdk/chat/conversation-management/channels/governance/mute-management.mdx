description: "Mute and unmute channel members to restrict messaging while allowing read-only participation."

<Info>
**Key Benefit**: Provide graduated moderation by restricting messaging while preserving channel access, offering a less severe alternative to banning for managing disruptive behavior.
</Info>

## Feature Overview

Mute Management allows moderators to restrict users' ability to send messages while preserving their ability to read and observe channel conversations. This provides a measured response to disruptive behavior without completely removing users from the community.

<Warning>
**Channel Type Limitation**: Mute functionality is not applicable to Broadcast and Conversation channels. Calling mute operations on these channel types will result in an error.
</Warning>

## Mute System Concepts

Understanding the mute system helps implement effective graduated moderation:

| Concept | Description | Duration Options |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Channel Mute** | User restricted from sending messages | Temporary or indefinite |
| **Read-Only Access** | User can observe but not participate | Maintains channel visibility |
| **Mute Duration** | Time-based restriction period | Minutes, hours, days, or permanent |
| **Auto-Unmute** | Automatic restoration after timeout | System-managed expiration |

<Note>
**Mute Characteristics**:
- Muted users can still read all channel messages
- Messages sent by muted users are rejected by the system
- Mute status is channel-specific (not global)
- Mutes can be temporary with automatic expiration or indefinite
- Only users with moderation permissions can mute/unmute members
</Note>

## Implementation Guide

  <Tab title="Mute Members">
    **Restrict messaging privileges for disruptive users**
    
    Apply temporary or permanent messaging restrictions while maintaining users' ability to observe channel conversations.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `muteMembers` | Restrict user messaging | Managing disruptive behavior |
    | `getMutedMembers` | List muted users | Reviewing mute status |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
   let channelModeration = AmityChannelModeration(client: client, andChannel: "<channel-id>")

do {
    let ismuted = try await channelModeration.muteMembers(["<user-id>"], mutePeriod: 600)
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
fun muteChannelUsers(channel: AmityChannel) {
    val userIds = listOf("user1", "user2")
    //
    channel.moderation()
        .muteMembers(userIds = userIds, timeout = Duration.standardMinutes(5))
        .subscribe()
}
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function muteChannelMembers() {
  /*
   * The default mute period is set to forever or until unmuted
   */
  const didMute = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.muteMembers('channelId', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  const FIVE_MINUTES = 5 * 60 * 1000;
  /*
   * This value can be overridden by passing a specific amount of time (in
   * milliseconds) as the
   * second variable
   */
  const didMuteForFiveMinutes = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.muteMembers(
    'channelId',
    ['userId1', 'userId2'],
    FIVE_MINUTES,
  );

  return [didMute, didMuteForFiveMinutes];
}
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
void muteChannelUsers() {
  final userIds = List.of(['user1', 'user2']);
  AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
      .moderation('channelId')
      .muteMembers(userIds)
      .then((value) => {
            //handle result
          })
      .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
            //handle error
          });
}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    **Duration Management**: The timeout parameter allows for temporary or permanent muting. Pass `-1` for indefinite muting, or specify time in seconds/minutes for temporary restrictions.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unmute Members">
    **Restore messaging privileges for muted users**
    
    Remove mute restrictions to allow users to resume messaging participation in channel conversations.

    ### Core Operations

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `unmuteMembers` | Remove mute restrictions | Restoring messaging privileges |
    | `getMutedMembers` | View muted user list | Managing mute status |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
let channelModeration = AmityChannelModeration(client: client, andChannel: "<channel-id>")

do {
    let unmuted = try await channelModeration.unmuteMembers(["<user-id>"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
fun unMuteChannelUsers(
    channelRepository: AmityChannelRepository,
    channel: AmityChannel
) {
    val userIds = listOf("user1")
    channelRepository.moderation(channelId = channel.getChannelId())
        .unmuteMembers(userIds = userIds)
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
}
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function unmuteChannelMembers() {
  const didUnmute = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.unmuteMembers('channelId', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  return didUnmute;
}
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
fun unMuteChannelUsers(channel: AmityChannel) {
    val userIds = listOf("user1")
    //
    channel.moderation()
        .unmuteMembers(userIds = userIds)
        .subscribe()
}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>
    **Unmute Validation**: Always verify that a user is actually muted before attempting to unmute them. Consider implementing notifications to inform unmuted users of their restored messaging privileges.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Graduated Moderation" icon="stairs">
    **Implementing progressive moderation strategies**
    
    - Use muting as an intermediate step before banning
    - Start with shorter mute durations and escalate for repeat offenses
    - Document clear escalation policies (warning → 5min mute → 1hr mute → ban)
    - Consider user history when determining mute duration
    - Provide clear communication about mute reasons and duration
    
    Graduated moderation helps users understand boundaries while maintaining community safety.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duration Strategy" icon="clock">
    **Effective mute duration management**
    
    - Use temporary mutes for first-time or minor infractions
    - Reserve indefinite mutes for serious or repeated violations
    - Implement automatic unmute notifications for transparency
    - Monitor mute effectiveness and adjust duration policies
    
    Strategic duration management balances correction with user experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communication" icon="message">
    **Clear mute communication practices**
    
    - Always provide reasons for muting actions
    - Use constructive language that promotes understanding
    - Explain expected behavior changes during mute period
    - Provide information about when mute will be lifted
    - Offer channels for appeals or clarification
    
    Transparent communication helps users learn from moderation actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitoring & Review" icon="chart-line">
    **Tracking mute effectiveness**
    
    - Monitor user behavior after mute expiration
    - Track repeat offenses to identify problematic users
    - Analyze mute reasons to identify common issues
    - Regular review of muted users for potential early unmuting
    - Use analytics to optimize moderation policies
    
    Continuous monitoring ensures mute policies remain effective and fair.
