<Info>
**Key Benefit**: Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions and moderation capabilities, ensuring proper channel governance and security.
</Info>

## Feature Overview

Role Management enables you to assign and manage different permission levels within chat channels. Roles define varying levels of access and permissions that can be assigned to users, allowing for structured channel governance and moderation.

  </Card>

<Warning>
**Channel Type Limitation**: Role management applies only to Live and Community channels. This feature is not available for Conversation and Broadcast channels.
</Warning>

## Role Hierarchy

Understanding the role hierarchy is essential for effective channel governance:

| Role | Authority Level | Capabilities |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Channel Creator** | Highest | Automatically assigned as moderator, cannot be removed |
| **Moderators** | High | Can promote/demote other users, manage channel activities |
| **Custom Roles** | Variable | Application-defined permissions |
| **Members** | Standard | Basic channel participation |

<Note>
**Important Rules**:
- The channel creator is automatically assigned as the channel moderator
- The last moderator cannot leave a community (error will be displayed)
- Channel moderators can promote users to moderators
- Channel moderators can demote other moderators to regular members
</Note>

## Implementation Guide

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Roles">
    **Assign roles to channel members**
    
    Grant users specific roles within channels to provide them with appropriate permissions and responsibilities.

    ### Core Operation

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `addRole` | Assign role to users | Promoting users to moderators or custom roles |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
// Add a role to member
do {
    let success = try await channelModeration.addRole("<role>", userIds: ["<user-id>"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
   fun addAndRemoveRoles(channelRepository: AmityChannelRepository) {
    //Add role
    channelRepository
        .moderation(channelId = "channelId")
        .addRole(role = "moderator", listOf("userId1, userId2"))
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
   import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function addRole() {
  const didAdd = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.addRole('channelId', 'role', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  return didAdd;
}

    ```

    ```dart Flutter
  final channelId = "channelId";
  final role = "moderator";
  final userIds = List.of(['user1', 'user2']);

  // Add role to channel members
  AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
    .moderation(channelId)
    .addRole(role, userIds)
    .then((value) => {
          //handle result
        })
    .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
          //handle error
        });

    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    **Best Practice**: Always validate user membership before assigning roles. Consider implementing confirmation dialogs for role assignments, especially for moderator promotions.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remove Roles">
    **Remove roles from channel members**
    
    Revoke roles from users to adjust their permissions or demote them from their current positions.

    ### Core Operation

    | Method | Purpose | When to Use |
    |--------|---------|-------------|
    | `removeRole` | Remove role from users | Demoting moderators or revoking custom roles |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
let channelModeration = AmityChannelModeration(client: client, andChannel: "<channel-id>")

// Remove a role from member
do {
    let success = try await channelModeration.removeRole("<role>", userIds: ["<user-id>"])
} catch {
    // Handle error here
}
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    //Remove role
    channelRepository
        .moderation(channelId = "channelId")
        .removeRole(role = "moderator", listOf("userId1"))
        .doOnComplete {
            // Void
        }
        .doOnError {
            // Exception
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

async function removeRole() {
  const didAdd = await ChannelRepository.Moderation.removeRole('channelId', 'role', [
    'userId1',
    'userId2',
  ]);

  return didAdd;
}
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
     // Remove role from channel members
  AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
    .moderation(channelId)
    .removeRole(role, userIds)
    .then((value) => {
          //handle result
        })
    .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
          //handle error
        });
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>
    **Last Moderator Protection**: The system prevents removal of the last moderator from a channel. Always validate moderator count before attempting to demote users.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Role Assignment Strategy" icon="strategy">
    **Effective role management approaches**
    
    - Assign roles based on user contribution and trustworthiness
    - Implement a clear role hierarchy that matches your community structure
    - Use gradual promotion paths (member â†’ moderator) rather than immediate elevation
    - Regularly review role assignments to ensure they remain appropriate
    - Document role responsibilities clearly for users and moderators
    
    Strategic role assignment creates well-functioning community governance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Management" icon="key">
    **Managing role permissions effectively**
    
    - Define clear permission boundaries for each role level
    - Avoid overlapping permissions that could cause confusion
    - Implement the principle of least privilege (minimal necessary permissions)
    - Use custom roles for specific use cases rather than overloading standard roles
    - Test role permissions thoroughly before deployment
    
    Well-defined permissions prevent conflicts and ensure security.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Moderation Oversight" icon="eye">
    **Monitoring and managing moderator actions**
    
    - Track moderator actions for accountability and training
    - Implement escalation procedures for complex moderation decisions
    - Provide moderator guidelines and training materials
    - Regular moderator performance reviews and feedback
    - Establish procedures for moderator misconduct
    
    Proper oversight ensures consistent and fair moderation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Robust error management for role operations**
    
    - Validate user membership before role assignment
    - Check for last moderator scenarios before role removal
    - Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations
    - Provide clear error messages for different failure scenarios
    - Log role changes for audit trails and troubleshooting
    
    Comprehensive error handling prevents governance disruptions.

<Tip>
**Implementation Strategy**: Start with basic role assignment and removal, then add validation and error handling. Implement role transitions and bulk operations for advanced use cases. Focus on creating clear governance policies alongside the technical implementation.
