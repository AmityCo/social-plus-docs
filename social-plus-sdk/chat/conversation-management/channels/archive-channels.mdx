description: "Archive and unarchive conversation channels to organize your chat list while preserving message history and functionality"

<Info>
**Organized Chat Management**: Channel archiving provides a clean way to organize your chat interface by moving less active conversations out of the main list while preserving all messages and functionality. Only conversation-type channels support archiving, with a maximum of 100 archived channels per user.
</Info>

## Archive Management

Channel archiving affects only the user who performs the action, providing personalized chat organization without impacting other participants.

## Archive Operations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Archive Channel">
    **Move channel to archived list**
    
    The `archiveChannel` function allows users to archive a specific conversation channel. Archiving a channel removes it from the active list channel but retains its data for future reference. This function takes one parameter, channelId, which specifies the ID of the channel to be archived.

    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
    |-----------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `channelId` | String | ✅ | Unique identifier of the conversation channel to archive |

    ### Archive Effects

    - **Effect for the User**: The archived chat is hidden from the user's main chat list view and moved to a separate archived chat list. This action only affects the user who archives the chat; the other participant(s) in the conversation will still see the chat in their main list as usual.
    - **Messages**: Archiving does not delete any messages within the chat. Users can continue sending and receiving messages within the archived chat just like a normal chat.
    - **Sorting**: Chats within the archived list are sorted based on the timestamp of the last message exchanged.

    ### Code Example

    <CodeGroup>
    ```dart Flutter
    void archiveChannel(String channelId) async {
      await AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .archiveChannel(channelId);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Important Considerations

    <Warning>
    **Channel Type Limitation**: Only 'conversation' type channels (like DMs) can be archived. Community, Live, and Broadcast channels do not support archiving.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Archive Limit**: A user can archive a maximum of 100 channels. An error message will be displayed if a user tries to exceed this limit.
    </Note>

    ### Message Behavior in Archived Channels

    - **Receiving New Messages**: If another user sends a message in a chat you have archived, the chat will remain in your archived list. It will not automatically move back to the main chat list.
    - **Notifications**: You will **not** receive push notifications for new messages arriving in channels you have archived. The system prevents notifications for channels marked as archived by the recipient user.
    - **Muted Chats**: If a chat is muted and then archived, it is treated as a normal, unmuted chat within the archive list regarding its behavior (though notifications remain disabled due to the archive status).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unarchive Channel">
    **Restore channel to active list**
    
    The `unarchiveChannel` function allows users to restore an archived conversation channel back to the active channel list. This function takes one parameter, channelId, which specifies the ID of the channel to be unarchived.

    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
    |-----------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `channelId` | String | ✅ | Unique identifier of the archived channel to restore |

    ### Unarchive Effects

    - **Effect for the User**: The chat is removed from the archived list and reappears in the main chat list.
    - **Sorting**: The unarchived chat is placed back into the main chat list according to the timestamp of its last message.

    ### Code Example

    <CodeGroup>
    ```dart Flutter
    void unarchiveChannel(String channelId) async {
      await AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .unarchiveChannel(channelId);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Query Archived Channels">
    **Retrieve list of archived channels**
    
    The `queryArchivedChannels` function allows users to retrieve a list of archived channels. This function uses a live collection to fetch the data and provides real-time updates on the fetching status. It also supports pagination to load more data when the user scrolls to the end of the list.

    ### Code Example

    <CodeGroup>
    ```dart Flutter
    void queryArchivedChannels() {

      final scrollController = ScrollController();

      // Prepare the query to get archived channels
      LiveCollectionStream<AmityChannel> collections = AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .getArchivedChannels();
      
      // Observe to the stream to get the data and fetching status
      collections.getStream().listen((event) {
        List<AmityChannel> channels = event.data;
        bool isFetching = event.isFetching;
      });

      // Load next page when reaching the end of the list
      scrollController.addListener(() {
        if (scrollController.position.pixels == scrollController.position.maxScrollExtent && collections.hasNextPage()) {
          collections.loadNext();
        }
      });

    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Query Features

    - **Live Collection**: Real-time updates when archived channels change
    - **Pagination Support**: Load more channels as needed for large archive lists
    - **Fetching Status**: Monitor loading state for better user experience
    - **Scroll Integration**: Seamless infinite scroll implementation
  </Tab>
