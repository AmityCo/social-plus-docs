## Channel Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Set up channels with custom metadata and permissions
2. **Management**: Update settings, manage access, and configure features
3. **Organization**: Query and organize channels for optimal user experience
4. **Archival**: Properly archive channels while preserving important data

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive channel names
- **Metadata Management**: Store relevant channel information for easy discovery
- **Permission Structure**: Set appropriate access levels from creation
- **Regular Maintenance**: Archive inactive channels to improve performance

<Tip>
Consider implementing channel templates for common use cases to ensure consistent setup and configuration across your application.
