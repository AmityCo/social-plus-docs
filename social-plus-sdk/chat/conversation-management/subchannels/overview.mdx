</Card>

## What are Subchannels?

Subchannels are nested conversation spaces within main channels that allow for:

- **Topic-based Organization**: Separate discussions by specific topics
- **Reduced Noise**: Keep main channels focused while allowing detailed discussions
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Create logical conversation hierarchies
- **Flexible Access**: Independent permissions and member management

## Use Cases

- **Project Management**: Separate channels for different project aspects
- **Event Planning**: Break down event discussions into specific areas
- **Customer Support**: Category-specific support channels
- **Community Forums**: Topic-based discussion areas

## Key Features

- **Independent Messaging**: Each subchannel has its own message history
- **Flexible Permissions**: Different access levels per subchannel
- **Real-time Sync**: Live updates across all subchannel activities
- **Easy Navigation**: Intuitive parent-child relationship management

## Best Practices

- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the subchannel purpose
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Keep the structure intuitive and not too deep
- **Access Control**: Set appropriate permissions for each subchannel
- **Regular Maintenance**: Archive unused subchannels to keep the structure clean

<Tip>
Consider implementing subchannel templates for common organizational patterns to maintain consistency across your application.
