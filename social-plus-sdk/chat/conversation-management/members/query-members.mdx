  <Tab title="Advanced Filtering">
    **Role-based and status-specific queries**
    
    Implement sophisticated member filtering to find specific member categories or user roles within your channels.

    ### Filter by Membership Status

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    // Query only active members
    let activeMembers = membershipParticipation
        .getMembers(filter: .member, sortBy: .lastCreated, roles: [])
        .observe { collection, change, error in
            // Handle active members only
        }

    // Query muted members for moderation
    let mutedMembers = membershipParticipation
        .getMembers(filter: .muted, sortBy: .firstCreated, roles: [])
        .observe { collection, change, error in
            // Handle muted members
        }
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    // Query members by status with role filtering
    channelRepository.membership(channelId = channel.getChannelId())
        .getMembers()
        .filter(filter = AmityChannelMembershipFilter.MEMBER)
        .roles(roles = listOf("moderator", "admin"))
        .includeDeleted(includeDeleted = false)
        .sortBy(sortOption = AmityChannelMembershipSortOption.LAST_CREATED)
        .build()
        .query()
        .subscribe()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    // Advanced filtering with multiple criteria
    const unsubscriber = ChannelRepository.Membership.getMembers(
      { 
        channelId: 'channelId',
        filter: 'member',
        roles: ['moderator', 'admin'],
        sortBy: 'lastCreated'
      },
      ({ data: members, onNextPage, hasNextPage }) => {
        // Handle filtered member results
      }
    );
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
    // Query with specific role and status filters
    final controller = PagingController(
      pageFuture: (token) => AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .membership(channelId)
          .getMembers()
          .filter(AmityChannelMembershipFilter.member)
          .roles(['moderator'])
          .includeDeleted(false)
          .sortBy(AmityChannelMembershipSortOption.lastCreated)

      pageSize: 20,
    );
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Search Members">
    **Keyword-based member discovery**
    
    Enable users to search for specific members by name or username within channels for enhanced user experience.

    ### Search Implementation

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    // Search members by keyword
var token: AmityNotificationToken?

let builder = AmityChannelMembershipFilterBuilder()
builder.add(filter: .member)

token = channelMembership.searchMembers
(
    displayName: "<display-Name>", 
    filterBuilder: builder, 
    roles: [], 
    includeDeleted: false
)
.observe({ collection, change, error in
    //..
})
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    // Implement member search functionality
    fun searchChannelMembers(keyword: String) {
        channelRepository.membership(channelId = channelId)
            .searchMembers(keyword = keyword)
            .includeDeleted(false)
            .build()
            .query()
            .doOnNext { pagingData ->
                // Handle search results
            }
            .subscribe()
    }
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    // Search members with keyword filtering
    const searchMembers = (keyword: string) => {
      return ChannelRepository.Membership.searchMembers(
        { channelId: 'channelId', keyword },
        ({ data: searchResults, hasNextPage, onNextPage }) => {
          // Process search results
        }
      );
    };
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
    // Search implementation with keyword
    void searchChannelMembers(String channelId, String keyword) {
      final searchController = PagingController(
        pageFuture: (token) => AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
            .membership(channelId)
            .searchMembers(keyword)
            .includeDeleted(false)
            .getPagingData(token: token, limit: 20),
        pageSize: 20,
      );
    }
    ```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Query Optimization" icon="rocket">
    **Performance and efficiency strategies**
    
    **Targeted Filtering**
    - Use specific filters to reduce result set size and improve load times
    - Combine multiple filter criteria when searching for specific member types
    - Consider your use case when deciding whether to include deleted users
    
    **Pagination Management**
    - Implement proper pagination for channels with large member counts (>20 members)
    - Use appropriate page sizes (20-50 items) to balance performance and UX
    - Load additional pages only when needed to conserve bandwidth
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Member Status Management" icon="user-check">
    **Handling different member states effectively**

    - **Banned Members**: Administrative interfaces with appropriate warnings
    - **Deleted Users**: Consider data retention and privacy requirements
    
    **Real-Time Status Updates**
    - Utilize live collections to receive instant status changes
    - Update UI immediately when member status changes
    - Handle status transitions gracefully in your interface
    
    **Privacy Considerations**
    - Respect user privacy when displaying member information
    - Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive member data
    - Consider anonymization for deleted user accounts
 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search & Discovery UX" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **User experience optimization for member discovery**
    
    **Search Implementation**
    - Implement debounced search (300-500ms delay) to reduce API calls
    - Provide real-time search results as users type
    - Show search suggestions or recent searches for better UX
    
    **Filter Interface Design**
    - Provide intuitive filter controls for membership status and roles

    - Provide clear error messages when queries fail
    
    **Progressive Enhancement**
    - Load basic member list first, then apply filters
    - Implement infinite scroll for seamless browsing
    - Cache search results for faster subsequent queries
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role-Based Access" icon="shield">
    **Implementing proper access controls**
    
    **Permission-Based Queries**
    - Filter query results based on user permissions
    - Restrict sensitive member information to authorized users only
    - Implement role-based visibility controls
    
    **Administrative Features**
    - Provide comprehensive member management for admins and moderators
    - Include banned and muted member views for moderation purposes
    - Implement bulk actions for efficient member management
    
    **User Privacy**
    - Respect channel privacy settings when displaying members
    - Implement appropriate member visibility controls
    - Consider opt-out preferences for member discovery
    
    ```kotlin Example: Permission-Based Filtering
    fun getVisibleMembers(userRole: String): Observable<PagingData<AmityChannelMember>> {
        val filter = when (userRole) {
            "admin", "moderator" -> AmityChannelMembershipFilter.ALL
            else -> AmityChannelMembershipFilter.MEMBER
        }
        
        return channelRepository.membership(channelId)
            .getMembers()
            .filter(filter)
            .build()
            .query()
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
**Implementation Strategy**: Start with basic member queries using default parameters, then progressively add filtering, search, and role-based access as your application grows. Use specific filters and pagination to optimize performance for channels with large member counts.
