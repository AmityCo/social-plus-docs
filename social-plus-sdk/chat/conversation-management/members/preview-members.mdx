## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    **Efficient member preview implementation** - Use preview members for UI
    display instead of querying full member lists - Cache channel data with
    preview members to avoid repeated API calls - Implement proper loading
    states while channel data is being fetched - Consider using skeleton screens
    for member avatars during loading
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Experience">
    **Enhanced member visibility patterns** - Display member avatars in
    overlapping circles for visual appeal - Show "+X more" indicator when there
    are additional members - Use fallback initials or default avatars for members
    without profile pictures - Implement hover/tap states to show member names or
    additional info
  </Accordion>
