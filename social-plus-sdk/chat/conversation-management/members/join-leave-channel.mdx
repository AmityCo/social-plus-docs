<Info>
**Seamless Membership Management**: Channel membership operations provide reliable joining and leaving functionality with idempotent behavior. Once joined, users can participate in conversations and receive updates, while membership status can be observed in real-time for dynamic UI updates.
</Info>

## Membership Operations

Channel membership management supports both joining and leaving operations with automatic membership tracking and real-time status updates.

## Membership Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Join Channel">
    **Add user to channel membership**
    
    The `joinChannel` function allows users to join a channel, making them a member of the channel. This function takes one parameter, `channelId` which is the ID of the channel that the user wishes to join.

    Once the user joins the channel, they will be able to participate in conversations and receive updates about the channel's activity. It is important to note that this function is idempotent, which means that it can be called multiple times without causing any issues. If the user has already joined the channel, a successful result will still be returned.

    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
    |-----------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `channelId` | String | ✅ | Unique identifier of the channel to join |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    do {
        let channel = try await channelRepository.joinChannel(channelId: "<channel-id>")
        print("Sucessfully join a channel: \(channel.channelId)")
    } catch {
        print("Unable to join a channel: \(error)")
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    fun joinChannel(channelRepository: AmityChannelRepository) {
        channelRepository.joinChannel(channelId = "channel1")
            .doOnSuccess { channel: AmityChannel ->
                // AmityChannel
            }
            .doOnError {
                // Exception
            }
            .subscribe()
    }
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

    async function joinChannel() {
      const didJoinChannel = await ChannelRepository.joinChannel('channelId');

      return didJoinChannel;
    }
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
    void joinChannel(String channelId) {
      AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .joinChannel(channelId)
          .then((value) => {
                //handle result
              })
          .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
                //handle error
              });
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
    **Idempotent Operation**: This function can be called multiple times safely. If the user has already joined the channel, a successful result will still be returned without any issues.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Leave Channel">
    **Remove user from channel membership**
    
    The `leaveChannel` function is used to disengage a user from a channel by removing them from the list of members. This function takes the `channelId` parameter, which specifies the ID of the channel that the user wishes to leave. Once the user has left the channel, they will no longer receive any messages or updates from the channel.

    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
    |-----------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `channelId` | String | ✅ | Unique identifier of the channel to leave |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    do {
        try await channelRepository.leaveChannel(channelId: "<channel-id>")
        print("Successfully leave a channel")
    } catch {
        print("Unable to leave a channel: \(error)")
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    fun leaveChannel(channelRepository: AmityChannelRepository) {
        channelRepository.leaveChannel(channelId = "channel1")
            .doOnComplete {
                // Void
            }
            .doOnError {
                // Exception
            }
            .subscribe()
    }
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';

    async function leaveChannel() {
      const didLeaveChannel = await ChannelRepository.leaveChannel('channelId');

      return didLeaveChannel;
    }
    ```

    ```dart Flutter
    void leaveChannel(String channelId) {
      AmityChatClient.newChannelRepository()
          .leaveChannel(channelId)
          .then((value) => {
                //handle result
              })
          .onError((error, stackTrace) => {
                //handle error
              });
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Observe Membership">
    **Monitor real-time membership status changes**
    
    You can observe the channel to determine changes in the membership status. If the user is banned from the channel, you would want to show the particular UI and move from the chat screen.

    For example, in the event of a channel ban, it's possible to implement the appropriate user interface, navigating the user to be redirected away from the chat screen.

    ### Membership Status Types

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `none` | User is not a member of the channel |
    | `member` | User is an active member of the channel |
    | `banned` | User is banned from the channel |

    ### Code Examples

    <CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    var token: AmityNotificationToken?

    func checkChannelMembership(channelId: String) {
        token = channelRepository.getChannel(channelId).observe { liveObject, error in
            guard let channel = liveObject.snapshot else {
                return
            }
            switch channel.currentUserMembership {
            case .none:
                print("The current user is not a member of this channel.")
            case .member:
                print("The current user is a member of this channel.")
            case .banned:
                print("The current user is banned from this channel.")
            @unknown default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ```kotlin Android
    fun observeMembership(
        channelRepository: AmityChannelRepository,
        channel: AmityChannel
    ) {
        channelRepository.membership(channelId = channel.getChannelId())
            .getMyMembership()
            .doOnNext { membership: AmityChannelMember ->
                val isBanned = membership.isBanned()
                
                // Membership type is one of
                //  - AmityMembershipType.MEMBER
                //  - AmityMembershipType.NONE
                //  - AmityMembershipType.BANNED
                val membershipType: AmityMembershipType = membership.getMembershipType()
            }
            .doOnError {
                // Exception
            }
            .subscribe()
    }
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { ChannelRepository } from '@amityco/ts-sdk';
    import { FC, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    const ObserveMembership: FC<{ channelId: string }> = ({ channelId }) => {
      const [data, setChannelMembers] = useState<Amity.LiveCollection<Amity.Membership<'channel'>>>();
      const { data: channelMembers, loading, error } = data ?? {};

      useEffect(
        () => ChannelRepository.Membership.getMembers({ channelId }, setChannelMembers),
        [channelId],
      );

      return null;
    };
    ```

## Channel Membership Concepts

Understanding the relationship between different channel operations is crucial for effective membership management:

### Operation Differences

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create vs Join vs Get Channel" icon="lightbulb">
    **Understanding channel operation distinctions**
    
    Each channel is identified by a unique `channelId`, which is any string that uniquely identifies the channel and is **immutable** through its lifetime. When creating channels, you can specify your own `channelId`, or leave it to social.plus's Chat SDK to automatically generate one for you.

    **Key Differences:**
    - **`createChannel`**: Guarantees that the requested channel is new (except for `conversation` type)
    - **`joinChannel`**: Attempts to join an existing channel and adds user to membership
    - **`getChannel`**: Only retrieves the channel Live Object but doesn't make the current user join the channel

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Membership Status Management" icon="users">
    **Real-time membership monitoring**
    
    When a user joins a channel, they can observe and chat with other users in that channel. They are also automatically considered a _member_ of that channel. The Chat SDK provides the ability to view which users are currently in the channel as well as invite other users to join the channel.

    **Membership Benefits:**
    - Participate in conversations and send messages
    - Receive real-time updates about channel activity
    - Access to channel history and member information
    - Ability to observe membership changes in real-time

    **Status Monitoring:**
    - Observe membership changes for dynamic UI updates
    - Handle banned status appropriately with user redirection
    - Track member additions and removals for activity indicators
    - Implement appropriate error handling for membership failures
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling & Edge Cases" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Robust membership operation handling**
    
    **Common Scenarios:**
    - **Channel Not Found**: Handle cases where the channel ID doesn't exist
    - **Permission Denied**: Manage situations where users lack join permissions
    - **Already Member**: Leverage idempotent behavior for safe retry operations
    - **Banned Users**: Implement appropriate UI flow for banned status

    **Best Practices:**
    - Always check membership status before performing channel operations
    - Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
    - Use membership observation for dynamic UI state management
    - Handle network failures with appropriate retry mechanisms

<Tip>
**Membership Strategy**: Use the idempotent nature of `joinChannel` to safely retry operations, and always observe membership status for dynamic UI updates, especially to handle banned user scenarios gracefully.
