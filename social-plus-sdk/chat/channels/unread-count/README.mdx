</Info>

The unread count feature in chat channels allows you to keep track of new messages and stay up-to-date with ongoing conversations. By providing a simple indicator of unread messages, users can quickly prioritize which channels require their attention. This topic provides instructions for managing unread messages in a chat channel.

We only support unread count on community, conversation, and broadcast channels. We do not support this feature in live channels. Mention unread in channels aren't supported as well.
