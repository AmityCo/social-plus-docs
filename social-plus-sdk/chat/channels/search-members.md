# Search Members

## Search Channel Members

The `searchMembers` function in the `AmityChannelParticipation` class is used to search for members in a channel when mentioning. It takes the following parameters:

The function returns a [live-collection](../../core-concepts/live-objects-collections/#live-collection) of `ChannelMember` objects. You can filter search results with more than one option, such as filtering by muted and banned users. The role filter takes the role enum as an argument.

If no keyword is supplied, the list of users will be organized alphabetically by display name. When a keyword is provided, the list will be arranged based on search rank.

Here's an explanation of the function parameter:

`displayname|keyword` : A parameter accepting the string for searching

`memberships`: A parameter accepting an array of enum of membership status, enabling filtering members with matching one of the member statuses.

* `MEMBER` ->  Active members
* `MUTED` ->  Muted members
* `BANNED` ->  Banned members

`roles` : A parameter accepting an array of roles, enabling filtering members with matching roles

`includeDeleted` : A parameter accepting a boolean value.

* `true` -> include a member whose user has been deleted
* `false` -> exclude member whose user has been deleted
