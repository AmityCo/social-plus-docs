# Moderation

Social Plus’s customer-centric nature ensures that security needs are kept at the forefront of the work we do. Our purpose has been to continuously develop features that are safe and ready to use. We power our moderators with tools to control and impose permissions that make their applications a safer place, for all users. We put the utmost importance on giving power to our clients to implement protocols that keep their applications healthy, safe, and compliant.
