## Member Control Actions

### Temporary Restrictions
- **Muting**: Prevent members from sending messages for a specified duration
- **Timeout**: Temporary removal from active participation
- **Warning Systems**: Progressive discipline before stronger actions

### Permanent Actions
- **Banning**: Complete removal from channels with optional duration
- **Channel Restrictions**: Limit access to specific channels only
- **Platform-wide Actions**: Account-level restrictions across all channels

### Permission Management
- **Role Assignment**: Grant or revoke specific permissions
- **Custom Roles**: Create specialized roles for different member types
- **Inheritance**: Manage permission hierarchies and role relationships

## Moderation Workflows

1. **Detection**: Identify problematic behavior through reports or automated systems
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and context of violations
3. **Action**: Apply appropriate moderation measures
4. **Communication**: Notify affected parties and document actions
5. **Review**: Monitor effectiveness and handle appeals

## Best Practices

- **Graduated Response**: Start with warnings before escalating to stronger actions
- **Clear Communication**: Explain reasons for moderation actions
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all moderation decisions
- **Appeal Process**: Provide fair mechanisms for reviewing moderation actions
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update moderation policies

## Implementation Considerations

- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently manage multiple members simultaneously  
- **Automation**: Integrate with automated moderation systems
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete logs of all moderation actions
- **Privacy**: Respect member privacy while ensuring community safety

<Tip>
Consider implementing a tiered moderation system where different severity levels trigger different automated responses, with human review for complex cases.
