# Messaging

Messages are JSON content containers that can have up to 20,000 characters or can weigh up to 100KB for custom messages. They will be synchronized among all channel users in real-time. If a message requires larger binary data (such as when sending files), we recommend to upload the data to another cloud storage service, such as AWS S3, and store the URL to the content in the message data.

In addition to the JSON message type, the SDK also provides support for common text and image message types. These additional types are built on top of the standard JSON message layer.

The message payload is always the same regardless of which Development Kit the user is using. Users also have a choice on what type of message they want to send.‌
