# social.plus Documentation Modernization Guide

## Agent Knowledge Transfer Instructions

This document contains essential knowledge and patterns for continuing the modernization of social.plus documentation. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality across all documentation pages.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Modernize, clarify, and reorganize social.plus documentation for SDK and UIKit components, ensuring best practices, visual clarity, and workflow orientation across all platforms.

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ SDK Documentation: Social module documentation (Communities & Spaces, Feed, Intelligent Search, Notification Tray) completed
- ✅ SDK Documentation: Chat module structure reorganized and significantly modernized
- ✅ SDK Documentation: Chat Conversation Management and Messaging Features - COMPLETED
- ✅ UIKit Documentation: Chat components (conversation, recent chats, group chat, live chat) - COMPLETED
- ✅ UIKit Documentation: Social components (feeds, posts, comments-reactions, content discovery) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Consistent modern patterns established across all completed pages
- ✅ Knowledge transfer documentation created and comprehensive
- 🔄 Remaining: Chat engagement features, moderation-safety, and additional advanced SDK features

## Critical Architecture Understanding

### UIKit vs SDK Relationship

**IMPORTANT**: UIKit is implemented **on top of** the SDK. This fundamental relationship must be understood and reflected in all UIKit documentation:

- **SDK**: Handles all data management, API calls, caching, business logic, and core functionality
- **UIKit**: Provides pre-built UI components that use the SDK internally for data and functionality
- **Developer Benefits**: UIKit accelerates development by providing ready-to-use components while maintaining full SDK flexibility

#### Documentation Implications:
- UIKit documentation focuses on component usage, customization, and integration
- SDK documentation focuses on data management, API integration, and business logic
- UIKit components leverage SDK features seamlessly without developers needing to manage data layer
- Cross-references between UIKit and SDK documentation should highlight this relationship

**Issue**: Code examples not working
**Fix**: Preserve original code exactly; add context around code, not within

#### Structure Problems
**Issue**: Inconsistent page structure
**Fix**: Follow the exact template provided; don't deviate from established patterns

**Issue**: Missing required sections
**Fix**: Use the modernization checklist to ensure all sections are present

**Issue**: Poor component usage
**Fix**: Follow component patterns exactly as documented in this guide

#### Navigation Problems
**Issue**: Pages not appearing in navigation
**Fix**: Check docs.json file paths match actual file locations exactly

**Issue**: Broken breadcrumbs
**Fix**: Ensure folder structure matches docs.json navigation hierarchy

### 📋 Emergency Contact Information

If encountering issues beyond this guide:
1. **Review Completed Pages**: Look at successfully modernized pages for patterns
2. **Check Documentation**: Refer to Mintlify documentation for component usage
3. **Validate Structure**: Use the checklist to ensure all requirements are met
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test changes before considering work complete

---

## Final Agent Instructions

### 🌟 Core Principles

1. **User First**: Every change should improve the developer experience
2. **Consistency First**: Following established patterns is more important than individual creativity
3. **Quality First**: Better to complete fewer pages excellently than many pages poorly
4. **Preservation First**: Never modify user content without explicit permission
5. **Architecture Clarity**: Always maintain clear distinction between SDK and UIKit functionality

### 🚀 Path to Success

1. **Master Both Templates**: Understand and follow SDK vs UIKit structure patterns religiously
2. **Preserve Context**: Always read existing content before making changes
3. **Validate Continuously**: Check your work against the quality standards
4. **Link Thoughtfully**: Ensure strong navigation between related features and clear SDK/UIKit cross-references
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all code examples and links work correctly
6. **Maintain Architecture**: Keep SDK (data/API) and UIKit (components/UI) roles distinct and clear

### 📈 Continuous Improvement

This documentation system is designed to evolve. As you work with it:
- Note any patterns that work particularly well for SDK vs UIKit documentation
- Identify areas where the templates could be improved
- Update this guide with new insights about SDK/UIKit relationship documentation
- Maintain the high standards that have been established for both documentation types

**Remember**: The goal is to create documentation that developers love to use and that helps them build amazing applications with social.plus. Every page should feel like it was crafted by an expert developer who understands both the technical implementation and the user experience, with clear understanding of whether they're working with SDK features or UIKit components.
