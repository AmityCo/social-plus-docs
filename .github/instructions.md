#### 📋 **Navigation Updated**:
- ✅ **docs.json completely updated** with new structure
- ✅ **All file paths corrected** in navigation
- ✅ **Proper overview files created** for each section
- ✅ **Cross-references updated** between related sections

#### 🎯 **Token Limit Mitigation Strategies**:

To prevent future token limit issues when working on this documentation:

1. **Work in Focused Chunks**:
   - Focus on one major section at a time (e.g., just Content Management)
   - Work on subsections independently (e.g., just Posts → Creation)
   - Reference the completed structure below instead of re-analyzing

2. **Use Structure References**:
   - Reference this instruction file for current state
   - Use file searches to locate specific files instead of full workspace scans
   - Focus semantic searches on specific directories when needed

3. **Prioritize by Impact**:
   - **High Priority**: Content Management (most used features)
   - **Medium Priority**: Discovery & Engagement (user-facing features)  
   - **Low Priority**: Communities & Spaces (administrative features)

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR CONTINUATION

When resuming work on this documentation:

1. **Content Enhancement** (Next Phase):
   - Modernize individual MDX files with better components
   - Add more code examples and implementation guides
   - Enhance existing overview files with architecture diagrams
   - Add troubleshooting and best practices sections

2. **Chat Module** (Future):
   - Apply same restructuring principles to Chat module
   - Organize by messaging workflows rather than technical boundaries

3. **Video Module** (Future):
   - Structure video features by use case (calling, streaming, recording)

### Current Status: ✅ RESTRUCTURING PHASE COMPLETE

**What's Done**:
- ✅ Complete Social module restructuring
- ✅ All files moved to logical locations  
- ✅ Navigation updated in docs.json
- ✅ Overview files created for all major sections
- ✅ Token-efficient workflow documented

**What's Next**:
- 🔄 Individual file modernization within new structure
- 🔄 Enhanced code examples and implementation guides
- 🔄 Chat module restructuring (future)
