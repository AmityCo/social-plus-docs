# Social Plus SDK Documentation Modernization Instructions

This document provides comprehensive instructions for modernizing and enhancing the Social Plus SDK documentation, with a focus on replacing legacy content with modern Mintlify MDX components and comprehensive developer-friendly documentation.

## üéâ MAJOR RESTRUCTURING COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ Social Module Complete Reorganization (DONE)

The Social module has been completely restructured into a logical, workflow-based organization that eliminates scattered functionality and creates intuitive navigation:

#### üîÑ **NEW STRUCTURE** (All files moved and organized):

1. **üìÅ Content Management** (`/social-plus-sdk/social/content-management/`)
   - **Posts** (`posts/`):
     - `creation/` - All post creation types (text, image, video, poll, etc.)
     - `management/` - Edit, delete, pin, review operations
     - `interactions/` - View, query, get, mention functionality  
     - `analytics/` - Post impressions and performance tracking
   - **Comments** (`comments/`):
     - `basic-operations/` - Create, edit, delete, view
     - `advanced-features/` - Mentions, reactions, real-time updates
     - `management/` - Query, search, organize comments
   - **Moderation** (`moderation/`):
     - `content-flagging/` - Centralized flagging for posts and comments
     - `review-process.mdx` - Structured moderation workflows

2. **üìÅ Communities & Spaces** (`/social-plus-sdk/social/communities-spaces/`)
   - `community-lifecycle/` - Create, update, delete, health monitoring
   - `membership/` - Join/leave, member queries, roles & permissions
   - `organization/` - Categories, structure, navigation systems
   - `discovery/` - Query, get, trending communities
   - `governance/` - Moderation, guidelines, conflict resolution

3. **üìÅ Discovery & Engagement** (`/social-plus-sdk/social/discovery-engagement/`)
   - `feed/` - Global feeds, custom ranking (moved from `/feed/`)
   - `search/` - Intelligent search (moved from `/intelligent-search/`)
   - `reactions/` - Add/remove, query reactions (moved from `/reactions/`)
   - `notifications/` - Notification tray (moved from `/notification-tray/`)
   - `stories/` - Create, delete, get stories (moved from `/stories/`)

4. **üìÅ User Interactions** (`/social-plus-sdk/social/user-interactions/`) - ALREADY COMPLETED
   - `follow-system/` - Follow/unfollow, requests, status, lists
   - `blocking-system/` - Block/unblock, manage blocked users

#### üîß **Key Improvements Made**:
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated "README" naming** - All files now use descriptive `overview.mdx` names
- ‚úÖ **Logical grouping** - Related functionality grouped by workflow, not technical boundaries  
- ‚úÖ **Centralized moderation** - All flagging and moderation in one place
- ‚úÖ **Better context** - Comments now contextually part of content management
- ‚úÖ **Reduced duplication** - No more scattered flagging across multiple sections
- ‚úÖ **Scalable structure** - Easy to add features without disrupting organization

#### üìã **Navigation Updated**:
- ‚úÖ **docs.json completely updated** with new structure
- ‚úÖ **All file paths corrected** in navigation
- ‚úÖ **Proper overview files created** for each section
- ‚úÖ **Cross-references updated** between related sections

#### üéØ **Token Limit Mitigation Strategies**:

To prevent future token limit issues when working on this documentation:

1. **Work in Focused Chunks**:
   - Focus on one major section at a time (e.g., just Content Management)
   - Work on subsections independently (e.g., just Posts ‚Üí Creation)
   - Reference the completed structure below instead of re-analyzing

2. **Use Structure References**:
   - Reference this instruction file for current state
   - Use file searches to locate specific files instead of full workspace scans
   - Focus semantic searches on specific directories when needed

3. **Prioritize by Impact**:
   - **High Priority**: Content Management (most used features)
   - **Medium Priority**: Discovery & Engagement (user-facing features)  
   - **Low Priority**: Communities & Spaces (administrative features)

### üéØ NEXT STEPS FOR CONTINUATION

When resuming work on this documentation:

1. **Content Enhancement** (Next Phase):
   - Modernize individual MDX files with better components
   - Add more code examples and implementation guides
   - Enhance existing overview files with architecture diagrams
   - Add troubleshooting and best practices sections

2. **Chat Module** (Future):
   - Apply same restructuring principles to Chat module
   - Organize by messaging workflows rather than technical boundaries

3. **Video Module** (Future):
   - Structure video features by use case (calling, streaming, recording)

### Current Status: ‚úÖ RESTRUCTURING PHASE COMPLETE

**What's Done**:
- ‚úÖ Complete Social module restructuring
- ‚úÖ All files moved to logical locations  
- ‚úÖ Navigation updated in docs.json
- ‚úÖ Overview files created for all major sections
- ‚úÖ Token-efficient workflow documented

**What's Next**:
- üîÑ Individual file modernization within new structure
- üîÑ Enhanced code examples and implementation guides
- üîÑ Chat module restructuring (future)

- **Replace with**: Inline code examples using `<CodeGroup>` and platform-specific tabs

### Required MDX Components
Use these modern MDX components consistently:

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```swift Basic Example
      // Code here
      ```
      ```swift Advanced Example  
      // Code here
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```kotlin Basic Example

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Feature Name" icon="icon-name">
    Description of the feature
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Parameter Name">
    **Type:** `string`
    Description and validation rules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

// Basic implementation
class BasicExample {
    // Simple, clear implementation
}

// Advanced implementation with error handling
class AdvancedExample {
    // Comprehensive implementation with:
    // - Error handling
    // - Loading states  
    // - Performance optimization
    // - Real-world patterns
}

// React Hook example
const useFeature = () => {
    // Modern React patterns

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User Action] --> B[Validation]
    B --> C{Success?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Process Request]
    C -->|No| E[Handle Error]
    D --> F[Update UI]
    E --> G[Show Error Message]
```
