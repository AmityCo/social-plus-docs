1. **Fill in** the required details for your new application, such as the application name and a specific region. **Choose region** for your application from the available options: Europe, Singapore, US, or Indonesia. The application will always connect to the server in the chosen region, and your data will be stored in that region.
2. You can now create up to **50 applications**, allowing for better management of a larger volume of applications. If you wish to **extend this limit**, you can contact our support team.

<Info>
Please note that the region cannot be modified once the application is created.
