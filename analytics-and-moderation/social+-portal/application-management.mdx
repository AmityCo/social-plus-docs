## Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">Use Email & Password or SAML SSO.</Step>

## Create an Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Creation">Click “Create Application”.</Step>
  <Step title="Name & Region">Enter unique name; select region (EU, SG, US).</Step>
  <Step title="Validate Quota">Confirm you remain within 50 application cap.</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">Click Next → Confirm to finalize.</Step>
  <Step title="Post-Create Tasks">Distribute app ID, configure security (Secure Mode, tokens) in Console.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>The selected region cannot be changed after creation. Choose based on latency, data residency, and compliance constraints.</Warning>

## Edit an Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate">Search by APP ID or Name or filter by Plan / Region.</Step>
  <Step title="Select">Click “Edit” next to target application.</Step>
  <Step title="Update">Modify name or descriptive metadata (region locked).</Step>
  <Step title="Save">Click Save; verify updated label appears in listing.</Step>
  <Step title="Communicate">Notify teams if name changes impact tooling / dashboards.</Step>
</Steps>

## Region Selection Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Latency">Pick geographically closest region to majority user base to reduce round‑trip time.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Residency">Align with legal / compliance restrictions (e.g., EU data constraints).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failover Architecture">Use separate applications in multiple regions rather than expecting in‑place region migration.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Growth Planning">Reserve name conventions (e.g., product-env-region) to avoid collisions.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Naming & Governance

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pattern">Use pattern: <code>&lt;product&gt;-&lt;env&gt;-&lt;region&gt;</code> (e.g., chat-prod-eu).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Ownership">Assign an accountable owner for each application for audits & incident response.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Tags (If Supported)">Apply tags for cost center, environment, and compliance classification.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Change Control">Document any rename in central log (date, old, new, approver).</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Capacity & Limits

<Info>You may create up to 50 applications. Contact support to request a higher cap with justification (e.g., multi-tenant SaaS segmentation).</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Request Increase">Approaching ≥ 45 apps with planned roadmap growth & clear separation rationale.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consolidation First">Audit unused / duplicate staging apps before expansion.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Metrics & Monitoring

| Metric | Purpose | Healthy Signal | Action Trigger |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| App Count Utilization | Track usage vs cap (50) | < 90% | ≥ 90% → consolidation review / raise request |
| Naming Compliance % | Standardized names / total | 100% | < 95% → enforce pattern |
| Orphaned Apps | Apps without owner | 0 | > 0 → assign or archive |
| Edit Frequency | Name changes per month | Low & intentional | Spike → investigate process drift |
| Region Distribution | Apps per region | Balanced vs strategy | Unexpected cluster → latency review |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Cannot create new app | Reached 50 cap | Archive unused or request limit increase |
| Region incorrect post-creation | Mis-selection | Create new app in correct region; migrate data; deprecate old |
| App not found via search | Typo / stale name | Use APP ID or confirm rename log |
| Frequent renames | Lack of naming standards | Adopt enforced pattern & approval gate |
| Latency complaints | Suboptimal region | Plan transition via new region app & user migration |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Immutable Region Awareness">Highlight region lock in internal onboarding docs.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inventory Reviews">Quarterly review for orphaned or redundant staging apps.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Documentation Sync">Update internal runbooks when app names change.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separation by Compliance Tier">Isolate higher compliance workloads to dedicated applications for clearer audit scoping.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
