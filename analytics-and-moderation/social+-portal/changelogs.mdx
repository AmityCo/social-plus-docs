    <Warning>
    **Important Migration Information**

    **For Existing Customers**: The expansion of this feature from super admin restriction is designed to have minimal impact on your current user experience.

    **Console Users**: No changes to your current login process. However, to access portal features, you may need to set up a separate account, which represents a minor change to your user journey.

    **Account Separation**: Existing console accounts will not be automatically connected to portal accounts - this maintains security boundaries between different access levels.
    </Warning>
