<Info>
Use this dashboard to understand how communities, posts, comments, and reactions are performing so you can amplify healthy spaces and intervene in declining ones.

## Daily Operational Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Filters">Choose date range, segment (e.g., product line or region), and optionally exclude internal/test communities.</Step>
  <Step title="Scan Activity Stack">Identify abrupt shifts in posts, comments, reactions, joins, or leaves vs prior days.</Step>
  <Step title="Review Net Growth">Check join vs leave differential—flag communities with negative multi-day streak.</Step>
  <Step title="Open Top Communities">Sort by engagement rate (not just raw posts) to find quality leaders.</Step>
  <Step title="Inspect Decliners">Communities with falling posts AND rising leave count—drill in for cause.</Step>
  <Step title="Check Reach vs Impressions">Validate distribution fairness—avoid over-saturation of a narrow audience.</Step>
  <Step title="Action & Log">Document interventions (feature, moderation, spotlight) and set a follow-up review date.</Step>
</Steps>

## Modules & Interpretation

### Community Activity Overview (Stacked Bars)
Shows aggregate daily counts for: Posts, Comments, Reactions, Members Joined, Members Left. Look for proportion shifts (e.g., comments dropping relative to posts may indicate lower discussion depth).

### Top Communities Table
Leaderboard with: Posts, Comments, Reactions, Members Joined, Members Left, Engagement Rate. Use relative KPI columns rather than just raw counts to avoid bias toward largest audience spaces.

### Reach & Impression Graph
Reach = unique users exposed. Impressions = total displays. High impressions with flat reach suggests repeated exposure to same users; rotate content spots to counter fatigue.

### Growth & Churn
Joined vs Left provides directional community health. Persistent churn outpacing joins → investigate content relevance, governance friction, or onboarding gaps.

### Content Velocity
Rate of new posts per active community. Helps detect stagnation or spam bursts. Sudden spike unaccompanied by reactions/comments may indicate low-quality or automated posting.

## Metrics & Formulas

| Metric | Definition | Formula (Illustrative) | Why It Matters | Action Trigger |
|--------|------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Posts | New posts in period | count(posts) | Core creation volume | Drop >20% w/w |
| Comments | New comments in period | count(comments) | Depth of discussion | Comments/Post ratio < baseline |
| Reactions | Emoji/like style reactions | count(reactions) | Lightweight engagement breadth | Reactions/Post ratio dips |
| Members Joined | New joins to communities | count(join events) | Acquisition into spaces | Join decline consecutive 3 days |
| Members Left | Departures / leaves | count(leave events) | Churn pressure | Left rising >15% w/w |
| Net Community Growth | Growth after churn | Joined - Left | Community trajectory | Negative 3+ days |
| Engagement Rate | (Comments + Reactions)/Posts | (C + R) / P | Quality vs spam | Falls below target band |
| Comment Depth | Avg comments per post | C / P | Conversation richness | < baseline percentile |
| Reaction Saturation | Unique reactors / reach | distinct(reactors)/reach | Engagement distribution | Concentrated small reactor core |
| Reach | Unique users who saw content | distinct(viewers) | Distribution breadth | Stagnant vs user growth |
| Impressions | Total content renders | sum(views) | Frequency / exposure | High impressions, flat reach |
| Frequency Factor | Impressions / Reach | I / R | Repetition index | > target (content fatigue risk) |
| Content Velocity | Posts per active community | P / active_communities | Sustain momentum | Sharp rise (spam) or fall (stagnation) |

## Benchmark Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Baseline Collection">Record metrics across first stable 2–4 weeks to establish internal benchmarks.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adaptive Thresholds">Use rolling median + standard deviation for anomaly detection (e.g., trigger if metric < median -1.5σ).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seasonality">Adjust comparisons for known weekly cycles (weekend dips, Monday surges).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cohort Splits">Segment by community age buckets (&lt;30d, 30–90d, &gt;90d) to avoid maturity skew.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality Guardrail">Require Engagement Rate above minimum before featuring a community.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Early Warning Signals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shallow Engagement">Posts rising while comments/post falling → encourage prompts/questions formatting.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Concentration Risk">High impressions with stagnant reach → diversify surfacing algorithm.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Churn Cluster">Net growth negative across multiple adjacent topic communities → check overlapping policy or feature change.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Spam Burst">Velocity spike + low reactions/comment ratio → apply moderation filters.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality Stall">Engagement Rate sliding slowly week over week → run qualitative sentiment check.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Engagement Rate drop | Low comment depth / passive reactions | Compare comments/post vs reactions/post | Add prompts; highlight discussion-oriented posts |
| Net growth negative | Churn event (policy change, incident) | Overlay join/leave with incident timeline | Publish transparency note; adjust policy UX |
| Reach flat; impressions high | Overexposure algorithm weighting | Review recommendation distribution logs | Tune ranking to broaden diversity |
| Velocity spike; low quality | Spam or bot posting | Sample post authors & content patterns | Tighten rate limits; enhance moderation rules |
| Reaction saturation low | Same small set reacting repeatedly | Unique reactors vs total reactions analysis | Encourage broader participation (badges, prompts) |
| Frequency factor high | Repeat impressions to same cohort | Examine impression distribution by user | Introduce capping / cooldown logic |
