# Raw Data Export

Raw Data Export lets you download detailed, row-level CSV files for the three most-used dashboard widgets—**Daily Engagements, Post Types, and Reach & Impressions**—so you can run deeper ad-hoc analysis than the on-screen charts allow. Each export is a point-in-time snapshot (up to 10,000 rows) delivered by email and arranged so the rows in your file reconcile exactly with the counts shown in the corresponding chart.

### Feature overview

#### Why use Raw Data Export?

* Drill into the **who, what, where** behind peaks and dips surfaced by dashboard widgets.
* Combine consistent column sets across widgets to answer cross-cutting questions (e.g. “Do power commenters prefer video posts?”)

#### What you get

| Widget              | File(s) sent                                 | Quick description                                                                 | Typical questions answered                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Engagements   | `posts.csv`, `comments.csv`, `reactions.csv` | Row for every post, comment/reply or reaction created on each selected day.       | _When did engagement spike? Who were the drivers?_ |
| Post Types          | `post_types.csv`                             | One row per post with full creator & target details.                              | _Is video creation up since our campaign?_         |
| Reach & Impressions | `reach.csv`, `impressions.csv`               | One row per post that was viewed on each day (regardless of when it was created). | _Which older posts resurfaced last week?_          |

1. **Select Content menu** and set your date range. The widget refreshes immediately.
2. In the widget’s header, click **Download icon**.
3. Confirm your **email address** (pre-filled from your account).
4. Press **Generate**. You’ll see an in-app toast confirming the request.
5. **Check your inbox**. When the file is ready you’ll receive an email with separate links for each CSV mentioned above.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x4C;arge files may take a few minutes; the email stays valid for 24 h._

### Understanding the CSV columns

Below is a high-level field reference.&#x20;

#### Common fields

| Column                                | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `date`                                | Day the action occurred (UTC, ISO 8601).               |
| `postId` / `commentId` / `reactionId` | Unique content IDs, useful for joins.                  |
| `posterUserId` / `commenterUserId`    | ID of the user who created the content.                |
| `targetType` / `targetId`             | _community_, _userFeed_, etc.—where the content lives. |

#### Widget-specific highlights

* **Daily Engagements – posts.csv** adds `postText`, `postType`, deletion flags and tag arrays so you can text-mine captions or filter by type.
* **comments.csv** includes parent comment references to let you rebuild threaded views.
* **Post Types** focuses on one row per post and inherits all post-level fields above.
* **Reach & Impressions** pairs `date` with `postId` so you can build time-series views of visibility.

### Data freshness & live-data policy

Each export is generated on-demand and reflects the **current state** of the selected timeframe:

* Deleted items are **omitted**.
* Edited captions show their **latest text**.

Think of it as a “frozen screenshot” taken the moment you clicked **Generate**.

***

### Best practices

* **Start narrow.** Filtering to a shorter date range keeps files under the 10k row limit and speeds delivery.
* **Join files for richer insight.** All CSVs share consistent keys (`postId`, user IDs, `targetId`) so you can quickly combine them in Excel, Google Sheets or BI tools.
* **Look beyond totals.** Pivot by `posterUserRole` to highlight power users, or chart `postType` trends week-over-week.
* **Archive large jobs.** Re-running the same export later will create a fresh snapshot that might differ if posts were edited or removed.

### Limitations

| Area        | Detail                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Row limit   | 10,000 rows per CSV. Split your timeframe if you expect more. |
| Frequency   | Manual on-demand only (scheduled exports are on the roadmap). |
| File format | UTF-8 CSV, comma-delimited, double-quoted where needed.       |

These limits align with other SaaS analytics tools to keep file sizes manageable and email delivery reliable.&#x20;

### FAQ

**Q : Can I get more than 10,000 rows?**\
A : Not yet. We chose 10k based on common SaaS thresholds; larger datasets are best handled via our API or data warehouse integrations (coming soon).

**Q : Does the export include private community data?**\
A : Yes—exports respect your dashboard permissions. If you can see a widget, you can export its detailed rows.

**Q : How can I automate weekly exports?**\
A : Until scheduled exports land, set a recurring calendar reminder and use the same date-range preset each week.

**Q : Why don’t I see lifetime reaction counts?**\
A : Raw Data Export captures _events_ (e.g., a reaction added on 14 Apr), not roll-up metrics.&#x20;
