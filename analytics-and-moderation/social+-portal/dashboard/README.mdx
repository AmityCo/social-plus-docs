description: "Unified guide to the dashboards: activity, community & content, chat, video, and AI social insights—what each shows, when to use them, and how to interpret KPI families."
---

<Info>
Use the Dashboard suite to answer three core questions: (1) Are we growing & retaining healthy users? (2) Is engagement deep, distributed, and safe across social, chat, and video surfaces? (3) What qualitative themes & gaps explain quantitative changes?

## When to Use Which Dashboard

| Scenario | Go Here | Primary KPIs | Typical Action |
|----------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Sudden user spike or dip | Activity | New / Returning Users, Concurrency | Validate campaign or investigate outage |
| A community declines | Social | Net Growth, Engagement Rate | Intervention (spotlight, moderation) |
| Chat feels noisy / spammy | Chat | Flagged Rate, MPAU (Message per Active User), Channel Concentration | Tighten limits, rebalance channels |
| Livestream buffering complaints | Video | Peak Concurrency, Avg Minutes / Viewer | Expand limits |
| Negative sentiment rising | AI Insights | Sentiment Score, Topic Skew | Root cause analysis & remediation ticket |
| Need custom cohort model | Raw Export | Event-level records | Build external analysis / ML |

## KPI Families

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Acquisition">New users, channel creation, new livestreams, new chat senders.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Retention">Returning Users, Active vs Inactive, 7d sender retention, viewer milestone retention.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Engagement Depth">Comments/Post, Reactions/Message, Watch Minutes per Viewer, Chat + Reactions per Viewer.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Distribution">Reach, Impressions, Channel Concentration Index, Resolution Mix.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality & Performance"> Peak Hour Factor, Peak Concurrency headroom.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Safety & Compliance">Flagged Messages, Flagged Rate, Flagged Items (video), Moderation backlog aging.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Qualitative Drivers">Sentiment Score, Topic Share %, Gap Index, Negative Theme Count.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Navigation & Filters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Date Range">All dashboards default to a rolling 30 days; adjust for weekly vs monthly analysis.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Segmentation">Common filters: date, category, platform, community, topic (AI Insights), channel type (Chat), stream host (Video).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Community & Topic Filters">Intersect topics with specific communities to localize emerging issues—maintain an unfiltered baseline tab for relative deltas.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cohort Views">Use new vs returning segmentation (Activity) and newly activated chat senders (Chat) to isolate onboarding health.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Volume Guardrails">Treat insights as directional if filtered mention volume or event counts fall below internal reliability thresholds.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Start (First Week)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish Baselines">Record medians for core KPI families (growth, engagement, quality, safety).</Step>
  <Step title="Set Thresholds">Define alert bands (e.g., ±1.5 IQR for retention & engagement rate).</Step>
  <Step title="Map Ownership">Assign metric families to responsible roles (Growth, Community Ops, Safety, Video Ops).</Step>
  <Step title="Create Weekly Ritual">15‑minute review using Activity → Social → Chat → Video → AI Insights sequence.</Step>
  <Step title="Instrument Feedback">Log every remediation with date + responsible owner to tie changes back to movement.</Step>
</Steps>

## Core KPI Snapshot Reference

| Domain | KPI | Definition | Why It Matters | Common Trigger |
|--------|-----|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Activity | Returning Users % | Returning / Active | Stickiness | % drops >5pts w/w |
| Activity | Peak Concurrency | Max simultaneous connections | Capacity risk | >80% provisioned |
| Social | Engagement Rate | (Comments + Reactions)/Posts | Quality over volume | Below target band |
| Social | Net Community Growth | Joins - Leaves | Community health | Negative 3+ days |
| Chat | MPAU | Messages / Unique Senders | Power user dependence | Sharp rise + flat senders |
| Chat | Flagged Rate | Flagged / Messages | Safety cleanliness | Above threshold |
| Video | Avg Min / Viewer | Minutes Watched / Unique Viewers | Retention depth | < baseline -15% |
| AI Insights | Sentiment Score | Weighted polarity 0–100 | Morale / satisfaction | Drop >5 pts d/d |
| AI Insights | Gap Index (Top) | Weight (search vol vs coverage) | Self-service opportunity | Top unchanged 2 cycles |

## Governance & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Benchmark Discipline">Capture baselines before launching growth experiments to avoid attribution confusion.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Anomaly Triage Path">Quantitative spike → filter segmentation → AI Insights for qualitative root cause → action ticket.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Vanity Metrics">Prefer rate & quality ratios (engagement per creator) over raw volume for decisions.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample Size Checks">Do not act on filtered sentiment if mention count below reliability threshold (define per tenant).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operational Cadence">Daily (safety & anomalies), Weekly (retention & quality), Monthly (cohort & strategy), Quarterly (benchmarks recalibration).</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
