    This metric helps you understand your streaming cadence and content production rate. A consistent or growing number of streams indicates active creator engagement.

    **Insights**:
    - **High Volume**: Strong creator activity and content supply
    - **Low Volume**: May indicate need for creator incentives
    - **Fluctuating**: Seasonal or event-driven patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Total Views

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Metric Overview" icon="eye">
    **Description**: Total times your livestreams were watched across all streams
