## Post Tabs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All Posts">
    The default view showing every post in your network within the selected date range. Each post displays full content preview with engagement metrics and admin action buttons.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pinned Posts">
    Shows posts that have been pinned by administrators. Pinned posts receive higher visibility in community feeds. Use this tab to manage which content is currently promoted.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flagged Posts">

    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Moderation Actions

Each post card provides three action buttons in the top-right corner:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Post Performance" icon="chart-line">
    Opens a detailed side panel with per-post engagement charts for Reactions, Comments, Impressions, and Reach over the selected date range. See [Post Performance Panel](#post-performance-panel) below.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delete Post" icon="trash">
    Permanently removes the post and its associated comments from the network. Use with caution—this action cannot be undone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pin Post" icon="thumbtack">
    Pins the post to the top of its community feed, giving it persistent visibility. Unpin by clicking the button again on a pinned post.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
You can also comment on any post directly as the network admin using the inline comment box beneath each post.
</Tip>

## Post Performance Panel

Clicking the **Post Performance** button (bar-chart icon) on any post opens a detailed side panel with time-series charts for that specific post.

<img src="/images/analytics-and-moderation/post-performance-scroll2.png" alt="Post Performance impressions and reach charts with time-series data" />

The panel includes its own date range picker, allowing you to analyse performance across different time windows independently of the main feed filter.

<Note>
Data is available from the post's creation date up to yesterday. Today's data is not yet included.
</Note>

### Performance Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reactions" icon="heart">
    **Definition:** Number of reactions (likes, emojis) on this post.

    Displayed as a daily time-series chart. Use to identify reaction spikes that correlate with distribution events or viral moments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Comments" icon="comments">
    **Definition:** Number of comments on this post.

    Tracks comment volume over time. A healthy post typically sees comments taper gradually after an initial burst—flat-lining immediately may indicate low engagement quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Impressions" icon="eye">
    **Definition:** Total times the content was viewed, including members and visitors.

    Measures raw exposure. Compare with Reach to understand whether the same users are seeing the post repeatedly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reach" icon="users">
    **Definition:** Unique people who saw the content, including members and visitors.

    Reach represents distribution breadth. A high Impressions-to-Reach ratio indicates repeated exposure to the same audience—consider broadening distribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Metrics Reference

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters | Action Trigger |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Reactions | Total reactions on the post | Lightweight engagement signal | Zero reactions after 24h of reach |
| Comments | Total comments on the post | Discussion depth indicator | Comments/Impressions ratio below baseline |
| Impressions | Total content renders (members + visitors) | Exposure volume | Flat despite distribution push |
| Reach | Unique viewers (members + visitors) | Distribution breadth | High impressions but stagnant reach |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Moderation Workflow" icon="clipboard-check">
    1. Start with the **Flagged Posts** tab to clear the moderation queue
    2. Switch to **All Posts** and scan for anomalies (spam bursts, engagement drops)
    3. Review **Pinned Posts** to ensure promoted content is still relevant
    4. Open **Post Performance** on key posts to validate distribution health
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Post Performance Effectively" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    - Compare Impressions vs Reach to detect audience saturation
    - Check Reactions and Comments trends to assess engagement quality
    - Adjust the date range to isolate specific campaign periods
    - Use the per-post data to inform content strategy decisions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content Pinning Strategy" icon="thumbtack">
    - Pin announcements, events, or high-quality community content
    - Rotate pinned posts regularly to keep feeds fresh
    - Limit pinned posts per community to avoid feed clutter
    - Monitor pinned post performance to confirm visibility impact
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Posts not appearing | Date range too narrow | Expand the date range or reset to "Last 30 days" |
| Metrics show zero | Post is very new | Data is available from creation date up to yesterday—wait 24h |
| Flagged tab empty | No flagged content | Healthy state; continue monitoring |
| Post Performance panel shows "No data" | Post has no engagement in selected range | Adjust the date range to cover the post's active period |
| Search returns no results | Keyword mismatch | Try broader search terms or clear filters |
