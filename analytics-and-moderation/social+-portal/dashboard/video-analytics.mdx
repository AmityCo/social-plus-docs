title: Livestream Analytics
description: Monitor livestream volume, audience reach, watch time, engagement, quality, and moderation signals to optimize video retention and capacity.
---

<Info>
Use this dashboard to understand how live video sessions perform—who joins, how long they stay, when they churn, and where quality or engagement drops create retention risk. Pair with moderation and raw export tools for deeper investigation.

## Fast Questions You Can Answer

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Content Supply">Are we producing enough streams to meet audience demand?</Tab>

## Daily Operational Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Scope">Pick date range & segment (region, category, creator cohort).</Step>
  <Step title="Scan KPI Cards">Streams, Unique Viewers, Minutes Watched, Peak Concurrency deltas vs prior period.</Step>
  <Step title="Check Concurrency Curve">Look for sharper peaks or plateau changes requiring scaling adjustments.</Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Retention Milestones">Inspect watch duration distribution to spot early drop-off points.</Step>
  <Step title="Review Engagement Rate">Compare chat messages & reactions per viewer to baseline.</Step>
  <Step title="Quality Distribution">Monitor resolution tiers (FHD/HD/SD) & bitrate shifts; investigate abrupt downgrades.</Step>
  <Step title="Top Streams Leaderboard">Identify exemplary or underperforming sessions—note anomalies.</Step>
  <Step title="Moderation & Safety">Check flagged content count & ratio; queue backlog if present.</Step>
  <Step title="Log Interventions">Record actions (promotion, creator coaching, infra tuning) and schedule follow-up.</Step>
</Steps>

## Modules & Interpretation

### KPI Cards
Provide macro health: production (Live Streams), audience (Viewers), consumption (Minutes Watched), engagement (Reactions / Chat), and performance (Peak Concurrency).

### Concurrency Trend
Visualizes simultaneous viewers across sessions/time. Rising volatility without capacity scaling → risk of buffering or join failures.

### Watch Time Distribution
Shows tails of viewing session durations. Healthy distributions shift gradually right as content relevance improves.

### Top Live Streams Table
Leaderboard enabling drill-down into Stream Title, Host, Start Time, Peak Concurrent Viewers, Unique Viewers, Minutes Watched, Engagement Rate, Flagged Items.

### Resolution / Quality Mix
Breakdown of minutes by FHD, HD, SD. Persistent drift toward SD may reflect network constraints or encoding fallback issues.

### Engagement Over Time
Overlay of chat messages & reactions against viewer count to spot interaction troughs where hosts can re-engage.

### Safety & Moderation Panel
Flagged chat messages / segments, automated policy triggers, and unresolved moderation queue aging.

## Key Metrics & Formulas

| Live Streams | Unique live broadcast sessions | count(stream_id) | Supply of content | Drop >20% w/w |
| Unique Viewers | Distinct users viewing ≥1s | distinct(user_id) | Reach & growth | Stagnant vs new user growth |
| Minutes Watched | Total minutes across all viewers | Σ session_minutes | Engagement depth | Decline without stream count drop |
| Avg Minutes per Stream | Consumption per broadcast | Minutes Watched / Live Streams | Stream effectiveness | < baseline -15% |
| Avg Minutes per Viewer | Viewer stickiness | Minutes Watched / Unique Viewers | Retention quality | Early drop-off spike |
| Peak Concurrent Viewers (PCV) | Max simultaneous viewers | max(concurrent_viewers_t) | Capacity planning | >80% infra headroom |
| Concurrency Growth Rate | % change in PCV vs prior period | (PCV_now - PCV_prev)/PCV_prev | Scaling forecast | >25% sustained increase |
| Chat Messages | Total chat messages in streams | count(chat_msg) | Interactive engagement | Flat while viewers rise |
| Reactions | Total live reactions | count(reaction) | Lightweight engagement | Ratio down vs baseline |
| Engagement Rate | (Chat + Reactions)/Unique Viewers | (C + R)/Viewers | Content resonance | Falls below target band |
| Flagged Items | Flagged chat or segments | count(flags) | Safety risk | Spike >30% w/w |
| Flagged Rate | Flagged / Chat Messages | flags / chat_msg | Moderation workload | > threshold (e.g., 2%) |
| FHD % | Share of minutes at FHD | FHD_minutes / total_minutes | Quality experience | Sudden drop >10 pts |
| Rebuffer Complaint Rate* | User reports / viewer sessions | complaints / sessions | QoE stability | Rise > baseline +2σ |
| Start Failure Rate* | Failed stream starts / attempts | fails / attempts | Onboarding friction | >1–2% sustained |
| Retained 5m Viewers | Viewers staying ≥5 minutes | viewers_5m / Unique Viewers | Early retention | Drop >10 pts |

## Analytical Lenses

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Acquisition">Unique viewers & new viewer share.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Engagement">Chat messages, reactions, Engagement Rate norms.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Retention">Avg minutes per viewer & milestone retention (1m / 5m / 25%).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality">Resolution mix, rebuffer & start failure rates.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Capacity">Peak concurrency slope vs infra headroom.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Safety">Flagged rate & moderation backlog aging.</Tab>

## Benchmark & Governance Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Baseline Period">Collect first stable 4 weeks post-launch to set medians & IQR.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adaptive Alerts">Trigger alert if metric leaves median ±1.5 * IQR (robust to outliers).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retention Milestones">Track % reaching 1m, 5m, 10m; focus improvements where steepest drop exists.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality SLAs">Define minimum FHD% or acceptable SD% band; escalate on rapid degradation.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capacity Planning">Forecast PCV at 4–6 week horizon using rolling CAGR to schedule scaling windows.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Safety Policy">Escalate if flagged rate breaches threshold twice within 7 days.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Early Warning Signals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Silent Streams">High viewers; low chat & reactions → prompt host engagement tactics.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality Degradation">FHD% drop + rise in complaints → inspect encoder/CDN edge.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Retention Cliff">Sharp fall at <Info>first 1–2 minutes</Info> → refine thumbnails, opening hook.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Scaling Risk">PCV acceleration vs unchanged infra provisioning.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Safety Spike">Flagged rate + backlog aging → add moderator or tighten auto filters.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Engagement Plateau">Stable reach; declining minutes per viewer → content pacing adjustment.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Minutes per viewer drop | Weak opening / content pacing | View retention curve first 5 minutes | Coach creators; improve intro hook |
| FHD% collapse | Encoder misconfig / network congestion | Compare bitrate logs & region distribution | Failover CDN; adjust adaptive bitrate ladder |
| Peak concurrency errors | Under-provisioned capacity | Error rate vs concurrency timeline | Pre-scale instances; add autoscale rule |
| High flagged rate | Inadequate moderation coverage | Flag timeline vs moderator shifts | Increase staffing; refine prohibited terms |
| Low engagement rate | Passive consumption / UI friction | Chat open rate vs viewers | Promote chat prompts; highlight Q&A moments |
| Start failure rise | Client version regression | Compare failures by app version | Rollback / hotfix offending version |
| Rebuffer complaints spike | Regional network issue | Geo segmentation of quality metrics | Route traffic alternate edge; adjust CDN config |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimize First Minute">Concentrate most compelling hook; retention early strongly correlates with total watch time.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Progressive Interactivity">Seed chat prompts at predictable cadence (e.g., every 3–5 minutes).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creator Feedback Loop">Share stream-specific leaderboard metrics with hosts for iterative improvement.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intentional Scheduling">Stagger high-demand streams to flatten concurrency peaks.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality Monitoring">Automate alert when FHD% drops & average bitrate declines concurrently.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Safety Automation">Combine keyword + behavior heuristics to preempt escalation surges.</Accordion>
