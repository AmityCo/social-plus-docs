description: Operational guide to interpret user growth, retention, concurrency, and feature adoption metrics in the Portal dashboard.

<Info>
Use this dashboard to monitor acquisition, retention, concurrency load, and cross-feature adoption so you can prioritize growth levers and capacity planning.

## KPI Overview (Main View)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Users">Users created in selected period. % delta compares to prior equivalent period. Sudden spikes: evaluate campaign attribution; drops: audit funnel.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Returning Users">Active this period AND prior period. Proxy for retention & stickiness. Track ratio returning / total active.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Inactive Users">Previously active but not active this period. Rising trend → trigger re‑engagement campaigns.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Concurrent Connections">Peak simultaneous connections. Use for infra scaling & capacity alerts.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Feature Usage">Overlap diagrams show multi-feature adoption (Chat / Social / Video). Higher overlap correlates with improved retention.</Tab>
  <Tab title="MTD MAU Progress">Daily accumulation toward month’s MAU; watch slope changes post-release or campaign.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Interpreting Feature Overlap

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why It Matters">Users engaging in multiple modalities (e.g., Chat + Video) typically have higher lifetime value.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimization">If one feature shows low overlap, embed contextual entry points or cross-prompts.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Historical Trends

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Range">Adjust date selector (e.g., last 30 / 90 days).</Step>
  <Step title="Concurrency Trend">Identify recurring daily/weekly peaks; align scaling schedule.</Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Table">Review active, churned (inactive), and resource consumption (video minutes, storage).</Step>
  <Step title="Pattern Flags">Look for divergence between active growth and returning stability (possible shallow engagement).</Step>
</Steps>

## Core Metrics Definitions

| Metric | Definition | Use Case | Watch For |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|
| New Users | Accounts created in period | Acquisition tracking | Spikes without retention lift |
| Returning Users | Previously active & active again | Stickiness / engagement | Declining ratio vs total active |
| Inactive Users | Previously active; no activity now | Churn monitoring | Uptrend across consecutive periods |
| Concurrent Connections (Peak) | Max simultaneous connections | Capacity planning | Peak nearing infra limit |
| MAU MTD | Unique users active month-to-date | Month pacing | Flattening mid-month slope |
| Feature Overlap % | Users using multiple core features | Adoption depth | Low overlap vs benchmarks |
| Video Watch Minutes (FHD/HD/SD) | Minutes consumed by quality tier | Bandwidth & cost mgmt | Disproportionate FHD spike |
| File Storage | Total storage consumed | Cost forecasting | Sudden growth (unoptimized media) |

## Leading Indicators & Actions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Early Churn">Inactive users rising week over week. Action: trigger lifecycle emails, in-app nudges.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Capacity Risk">Concurrent peak >80% of provisioned. Action: scale infra / implement rate smoothing.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Adoption Gap">Low Chat+Video overlap. Action: add contextual share/join prompts in video surfaces.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Storage Surge">File storage slope acceleration. Action: implement media retention policy / compression.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality Shift">FHD minutes ratio jumps. Action: validate encoding defaults & user network conditions.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dashboards Operating Cadence

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily">Check new vs returning, concurrency anomalies.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly">Trend inactive, overlap %, video quality distribution.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monthly">Cohort retention, capacity headroom, cost drivers.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quarterly">Benchmark adoption vs product roadmap targets.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| New Users spike; returning flat | Low first-week activation | Improve onboarding sequence & feature discovery |
| Concurrency plateau while new users grow | Session clustering / timezone pattern | Rebalance infra schedule; analyze session length |
| Inactive surge after release | Regression or UX friction | Review release telemetry & session error logs |
| Video minutes drop, storage rising | Incomplete uploads accumulating | Implement cleanup of failed uploads |
| FHD minutes sudden spike | Default quality forced high | Re-enable adaptive bitrate / CDN config check |
