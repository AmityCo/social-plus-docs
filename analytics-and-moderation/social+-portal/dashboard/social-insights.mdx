## Community & Topic Filtering

<Info>
Refine any insight to the communities and topics that matter—filtering removes noise so trend, sentiment, and gap signals stay actionable.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Topic Filter" icon="hash">Focus on specific themes</Card>
  <Card title="Community Filter" icon="users">Isolate audience segments</Card>
  <Card title="Combined Scope" icon="target">Intersect topic + community for precision</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why Use Community-Level Filters?

- Targeted insights: Each community exhibits distinct engagement & sentiment patterns.
- Faster diagnosis: Narrow scope to confirm whether an issue is broad or localized.
- Segment strategies: Tailor interventions (content, moderation, onboarding) per cohort.
- Reduce noise: Avoid dilution from mega-communities overshadowing smaller niches.

### Getting Started

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Access | Portal login with Social Insights permission |
| Feature Enablement | Social Insights enabled (contact support if disabled) |
| Data Window | Default range (e.g., last 30 days)—adjust as needed |

### Interface Tour

| Element | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Filter Bar | Top of insights view | Houses Topic & Community selectors + date range |
| Topic Dropdown | Left selector | Choose one or multiple topics to include |
| Community Dropdown | Right selector | Search & pick one or more communities |
| Date Range | Right side | Adjust temporal scope for comparison |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default View">All communities & topics aggregated (e.g., total mentions count across full corpus) until any filter is applied.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Progressive Narrowing">Apply topic first to isolate theme, then add community filter to test audience-specific variance.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset Strategy">If results feel sparse, clear the most recently added filter first to widen context.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Applying Filters (Step-by-Step)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Topic Menu">Click Topic: Select topic; search or scroll the list.</Step>
  <Step title="Select Topic(s)">Choose one (start simple) or multi-select to form a thematic cluster.</Step>
  <Step title="Observe Metrics">Note changes in Total Mentions, sentiment bars, emerging topics list.</Step>
  <Step title="Add Community Filter">Open Community: Select community; search e.g. "Fashion & Style"; select.</Step>
  <Step title="Compare Before/After">Is sentiment skew or gap profile materially different? Capture delta.</Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">Test additional communities to spot outliers; avoid over-filtering below statistically meaningful volume.</Step>
</Steps>

### Interpreting Filtered Results

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low Volume Caution">If filtered mentions fall below reliability threshold (internal baseline), treat insights as directional only.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Divergent Sentiment">A community showing negative skew vs global baseline indicates localized friction—investigate context posts.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Gap Localization">High Gap Index within one community reveals niche documentation/content deficit.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Adoption Variance">Topic share % shifts highlight uneven feature or content adoption patterns.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalation Routing">Community-specific negative themes can route to specialized support or product squads.</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Best Practice Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sequential Filtering">Apply topic FIRST to anchor analysis, then layer community to avoid premature fragmentation.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Benchmark Preservation">Keep an unfiltered baseline tab open for quick relative comparisons.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Volume Guardrail">Set a minimum mentions threshold (e.g., 300) for acting on sentiment shifts.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Change Logging">Record filter combinations used when generating recommendations to ensure reproducibility.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Periodic Reset">Once per week, review global view to avoid tunnel vision from niche segments.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Workflow

1. Start unfiltered → identify emerging topic.
2. Apply topic filter → confirm growth & sentiment skew.
3. Add top 3 related communities → detect which exhibits worst negative skew.
4. Run AI Research prompt: "Root causes of negative sentiment about &lt;topic&gt; in &lt;community&gt;." 
5. Validate references → create targeted remediation ticket.

<Info>Combining topic + community filters early in investigation accelerates root cause isolation but always validate sample size before action.</Info>

## Modules & Interpretation

### Mentions & Topic Breakdown
Highlights conversation concentration. A healthy distribution usually shows a balanced long-tail—extreme concentration may indicate a blocking issue OR a successful campaign.

### Trend Graph
Multi-line frequency lines reveal acceleration or decay. Sustained upward slope + positive sentiment → amplify; upward + negative → triage.

### Sentiment (Overall + Per Topic)
Overall gauge (0–100). Correlate dips with deployment timestamps or incident reports. Topic sentiment bars isolate outlier issues masked by aggregate positivity.

### AI Post Summaries
Condense thousands of posts into 5–10 key statements per sentiment polarity. Treat as directional—spot check references before broad decisions.

### AI Recommendations
Strategic remediation / opportunity list derived from the weighted intersection of volume, sentiment skew, and recency. Confidence score (if shown) reflects model certainty; low-confidence items may require manual verification.

### AI Research (Conversational Analyst)
Natural language Q&A across indexed conversations. Returns a structured mini-report: Introduction, Methodology, Findings, References (canonical post links) to enable traceability.

### Search Insights & Content Gaps
Maps expressed intent (search queries) vs existing content coverage. Gap Index ranks unmet demand to drive documentation & self-service improvements.

## Metrics & Signals

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters | Action Trigger |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Total Mentions | Total topic references in filtered period | Measures conversation volume / engagement energy | Spike > X% without planned campaign |
| Topic Share % | Mentions of topic / total mentions | Identifies dominance or neglect | Single topic >40% share 2+ days |
| Emerging Topic | Topic with high period-over-period growth and baseline low prior volume | Surfacing new opportunities or issues | Growth rate > threshold (e.g., >150%) |
| Overall Sentiment Score | Normalized weighted sentiment across posts (0–100) | Health & morale indicator | Drop of >5 pts d/d or >8 pts w/w |
| Topic Sentiment Skew | Deviation between topic sentiment and overall baseline | Prioritizes hotspots | Negative skew > (baseline -10) |
| Negative Summary Themes Count | Distinct negative themes extracted | Complexity of issues / support load | Rapid increase in count |
| Total Searches | Volume of internal search queries | Demand / intent scale | Sustained decline (possible UX findability issue) |
| Trending Searches Count | # of search terms with rapid growth | Emerging informational needs | Large increase → accelerate content creation |
| Content Gap Count | Unique queries with low/no results | Self-service deficiency | > predetermined target |
| Gap Index | Weighted (query volume vs results available) | Prioritization of content production | Top index unchanged across cycles (stale backlog) |
| Zero-Result Rate % | (Queries with no result) / total searches | Support deflection efficiency | Rate > target (e.g., >8%) |
