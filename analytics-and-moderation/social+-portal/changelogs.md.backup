## Version 2.17.0 (2024-01-26)

### New Features

* Introduced a new Account Management feature in our Social Plus Portal. This addition enhances the collaborative capabilities of your team, allowing multiple users to log in simultaneously and manage network applications and accounts effectively. For further details, please visit - [account-management.md](account-management.md "mention").

<Info>
**For existing customers**, the expansion of this feature, previously restricted to super admins, is anticipated to have a negligible effect on your user experience.

**Console users** will experience no changes in their login process. However, to use portal features, they may need to set up a separate account, resulting in a minor alteration to their user journey. It's important to note that existing console accounts will not be interconnected with portal accounts.
