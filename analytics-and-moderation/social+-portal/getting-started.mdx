Admin Portal provides three different sign-in options to cater to your organization's needs and preferences. These options are designed to provide convenience and security for users accessing the portal. Access the sign-in page at https://portal.social.plus/login.

<Info>
Access the unified Portal to manage applications, organization configuration, and secure administrator access. This guide covers current sign‑in methods (Email & SAML SSO), rollout, and operational best practices. Google sign-in has been deprecated (@gmail domain).
</Info>

<Warning>Google sign-in (@gmail domain) has been deprecated and is no longer available. Migrate any residual flows to SAML SSO or Email + Password.</Warning>

## Sign-In Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email & Password">Direct portal credentials (use for initial access or controlled break‑glass fallback).</Tab>
  <Tab title="SAML SSO">Enterprise IdP handles authentication; users provisioned automatically on first assertion.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## SSO (SAML) Enablement Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Engage Support">Contact support with org domain & desired scope (all users or whitelist subset).</Step>
  <Step title="Configure IdP">Set Assertion Consumer (Response) URL: https://amity-portal-prod-auth.amity.co/saml2/idpresponse</Step>
  <Step title="Audience Restriction">urn:amazon:cognito:sp:eu-central-1_gcJoCA15K</Step>
  <Step title="Attribute Mapping">Map email → http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress</Step>
  <Step title="Domain Sign-In">Users choose “Sign in with SSO”, enter org domain, redirected to IdP.</Step>
  <Step title="User Migration">Existing portal accounts linked to SSO identities post first successful SAML assertion.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Delete legacy direct admin accounts before activation if you want to strictly enforce SSO-only access.</Warning>

## Post-SSO Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Provisioning">New SSO-authenticated users are created with default access model on first login.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Console User Creation Disabled">Manual creation in Console is restricted to prevent identity fragmentation.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legacy Accounts">Existing non-SSO accounts remain functional unless explicitly removed.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security Consolidation">Central revocation at IdP immediately prevents portal access.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Migration Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before Enablement">Inventory current admin users; decide which persist; communicate cutover date.</Tab>
  <Tab title="During Cutover">Enable SSO in low-traffic window; monitor first login success rate.</Tab>
  <Tab title="After Enablement">Remove unused credential accounts; audit access logs; refine group mapping.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Metrics & Monitoring

| Metric | Purpose | Healthy Signal | Action Trigger |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| First Login Success % | Onboarding friction | ≥ 95% | Drop → review IdP attribute mapping |
| Legacy Account Count | Progress toward full SSO adoption | Trending to 0 | Flat > 0 for 2 cycles → enforce cleanup |
| SSO Provision Time | Automation latency | < 30s | Delays → check webhook / IdP latency |
| Failed SAML Assertions | Detect config issues | Near 0 | Spike → validate Audience / ACS URL |
| Duplicate Emails | Identity collision | 0 | Any → merge / remove stale account |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| SSO option not shown | Org not enabled | Confirm enablement with support |
| Assertion Consumer mismatch | Wrong ACS URL | Update IdP to official URL | 
| Audience validation error | Incorrect Audience string | Use urn:amazon:cognito:sp:eu-central-1_gcJoCA15K |
| User loops back to login | Attribute (email) not mapped | Map email claim correctly |
| Duplicate account created | Case variation in email | Normalize email casing & merge |
| Cannot remove legacy account | Still active sessions | Terminate sessions then delete |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Least Privilege">Leverage IdP groups to scope admin roles (avoid broad default grants).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Periodic Review">Quarterly audit of active SSO users vs HR roster.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Break-Glass Access">Maintain one monitored credential account for emergency (rotate often).</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication Plan">Notify administrators of SSO switch ahead of time with clear rollback steps.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logging & Alerting">Integrate portal login events into SIEM for anomaly detection.</Accordion>
