## Deep Link & Sharing Overview

The following table outlines the configurable URL patterns for different content types. These settings allow you to define the structure for shareable links.

| Setting                 | Description                                                                      | Placeholder     | Example |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Domain              | Your primary web domain, used as the base for all generated links.               | N/A              | `social.plus` |
| Post Pattern        | The path for web and mobile deep links to individual posts.                      | `{postId}`      | `social.plus/{postId}` |
| Livestreams Pattern | The path for web and mobile deep links to livestreams.                           | `{livestreamId}`| `social.plus/{livestreamId}` |
| Communities Pattern | The path for web and mobile deep links to communities.                           | `{communityId}` | `social.plus/{communityId}` |
| Users Pattern       | The path for web and mobile deep links to user profiles.                         | `{userId}`      | `social.plus/{userId}` |

<Warning>While we generates links based on your patterns, you must implement in-app routing. Your app is responsible for handling incoming URLs, navigating to the correct content, and managing access for private items, like prompting non-members to log in.</Warning>
