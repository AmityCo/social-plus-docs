### Admin API Access Token <a href="#admin-api-access-token" id="admin-api-access-token"></a>

If you want to request Social Plus APIs as an admin, you will need an access token. You can get the Access token from the Admin Users Management section in the console.

<Warning>
You must be logged in as an admin to generate an Admin Access token.

The root/super-admin account cannot generate an Admin Access token because you will not be able to see a Settings button if you are logged in using that account.
</Warning>

Once logged in as an admin, you can generate the access token with these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Admin Users**.
2. Click the settings '...' button. **Admin token** will pop-up.
