## Webhooks

<Info>Need full event catalog, payload schema, retry logic, and signature details? See the complete reference: <a href="../../social+-apis-and-services/webhook-event">Webhook Events Reference</a>.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Endpoint">Enter HTTPS URL in Webhook section.</Step>
  <Step title="Secret Issued">Console generates secret key tied to that URL.</Step>
  <Step title="Validate Signature">Configure backend to verify HMAC (secret) per event.</Step>
  <Step title="Rotate Secret">Delete & re-add endpoint if compromise suspected.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Use publicly reachable HTTPS endpoints; avoid including query secrets in the URL.</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Best Practices">Idempotent processing, 200 fast ACK then async work, exponential retry logic on your side.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">Restrict IPs if possible; verify signature before queuing work.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Versioning">Include event schema version in payload to future‑proof consumers.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Push Notification Certificates

More than one certificate can be stored per platform (e.g., staging + production) but only one active at a time per platform/provider.

| Field | Platform Scope | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Certificate Name | All | Internal tracking label |
| Platform | iOS / Android | Target OS |
| Provider (Android) | Android | Firebase / Baidu selection |
| API Key / Secret (Android) | Android | Credentials for chosen provider |
| .p12 Upload | iOS | APNs authentication material |
| Credential Password | iOS | Password for p12 if set |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Credential">Obtain APNs p12 or FCM/Baidu server keys.</Step>
  <Step title="Upload">Console → Settings → Integrations → Certificates → Upload.</Step>
  <Step title="Activate">Set active certificate for environment (staging / prod pattern).</Step>
  <Step title="Verify">Send test notification to confirm delivery.</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Keep staging & production clearly labeled to avoid cross‑environment delivery errors.</Info>

## Network Level Push Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Enable">
    Toggle Network Notification Settings ON to allow any push events. Only Super / General Admins can change.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Select Events">
    After enabling network level, choose Chat / Post / Comment / Story events individually to align with engagement goals.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Prerequisites">Certificates must be uploaded & active before toggling events or they will silently fail.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Turning the master toggle OFF immediately disables all push events (Chat, Social, Story).</Warning>

## Custom Push Message

Define templates or overrides per event type if supported. Keep copies concise (&lt;140 chars) and actionable.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Localization">Store translation keys instead of raw strings; expand at client side.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalization">Include displayName when appropriate but avoid sensitive content in payload.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">Throttle bursts to prevent notification fatigue.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring & Metrics

| Metric | Description | Trigger |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Delivery Success % | Successful pushes / total | Drop < 95% → inspect certs & provider status |
| Cert Days to Expiry | Soonest certificate expiry | < 30 days → schedule renewal |
| Event Coverage | Enabled events / intended events | Gap → enable missing categories |
| Webhook Failure Rate | 4xx/5xx responses / total deliveries | > 2% → investigate endpoint health |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| No push delivered | Inactive certificate | Activate correct cert; test again |
| Some events silent | Event toggle off | Enable event in Network Settings |
| Webhook 401 errors | Secret mismatch | Regenerate secret and update backend |
| Elevated retries | Endpoint latency | Optimize processing / return 200 quickly |
| Duplicate notifications | Missing idempotency | Track delivery IDs, discard repeats |
