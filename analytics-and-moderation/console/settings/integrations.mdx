## Webhooks

<Info>Need full event catalog, payload schema, retry logic, and signature details? See the complete reference: <a href="/analytics-and-moderation/social+-apis-and-services/webhook-event">Webhook Events Reference</a>.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Endpoint">Enter HTTPS URL in **Settings → Webhook** section.</Step>
  <Step title="Secret Issued">Console generates secret key tied to that URL.</Step>
  <Step title="Validate Signature">Configure backend to verify HMAC (secret) per event.</Step>
  <Step title="Rotate Secret">Delete & re-add endpoint if compromise suspected.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Use publicly reachable HTTPS endpoints; avoid including query secrets in the URL.</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Best Practices">Idempotent processing, 200 fast ACK then async work, exponential retry logic on your side.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">Restrict IPs if possible; verify signature before queuing work.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Versioning">Include event schema version in payload to future‑proof consumers.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Push Notifications

Navigate to **Settings → Push notifications** in the console to manage notification settings and certificates.

<img src="/images/console-push-notifications-overview.png" alt="Push notifications overview" />

### Enable Push Notifications

Use the master toggle at the top of the page to enable or disable push notifications for the entire network.

<Warning>Turning the master toggle OFF immediately disables **all** push events (Chat, Community, Live Stream). Certificates must be uploaded and active before toggling events, or notifications will silently fail.</Warning>

### Certificates

Multiple certificates can be stored per platform (e.g., staging + production), but only **one can be active at a time** per platform/provider.

<Warning>Starting June 01, 2024, Google will no longer support mobile push notifications via legacy FCM v1 APIs. Migrate to FCM v1 before this date.</Warning>

| Field | Platform Scope | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Certificate Name | All | Internal tracking label |
| Platform | iOS / Android | Target OS |
| Provider (Android) | Android | Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) / Baidu Cloud Push |
| Service Account JSON (FCM) | Android | FCM v1 service account credentials |
| .p12 / .p8 Upload | iOS | APNs authentication material |
| Credential Password | iOS | Password for .p12 if set |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Credential">Obtain APNs .p12/.p8 certificate or FCM service account JSON / Baidu server keys.</Step>
  <Step title="Upload">Console → **Settings → Push notifications → Certificates → Add new certificate**.</Step>
  <Step title="Activate">Toggle the **Active** switch for the certificate you want to use per environment.</Step>
  <Step title="Verify">Send a test notification to confirm delivery.</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Keep staging & production certificates clearly labeled to avoid cross‑environment delivery errors.</Info>

### Notification Events

Configure which events trigger push notifications. Events are organized into three tabs:

<img src="/images/console-push-notifications-chat-events.png" alt="Chat events configuration" />

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chat Events">
    Chat-related push notification events:

    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|

    | When there is a new message in the users channel | Notifies on new messages in channels |

    Standalone live stream push notification events:

    | Event | Description |

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Push Message

Click the **Actions** (pencil icon) button next to any event to customize the notification message template. Keep messages concise (&lt;140 chars) and actionable.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Localization">Store translation keys instead of raw strings; expand at client side.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalization">Include displayName when appropriate but avoid sensitive content in payload.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">Throttle bursts to prevent notification fatigue.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring & Metrics

| Metric | Description | Trigger |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Delivery Success % | Successful pushes / total | Drop < 95% → inspect certs & provider status |
| Cert Days to Expiry | Soonest certificate expiry | < 30 days → schedule renewal |
| Event Coverage | Enabled events / intended events | Gap → enable missing categories |
| Webhook Failure Rate | 4xx/5xx responses / total deliveries | > 2% → investigate endpoint health |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| No push delivered | Inactive certificate | Activate correct cert in Certificates table |
| Some events silent | Event toggle off | Enable event under the appropriate tab |
| FCM legacy errors | Using deprecated FCM v1 API | Migrate to FCM v1 with service account JSON |
| Webhook 401 errors | Secret mismatch | Regenerate secret and update backend |
| Elevated retries | Endpoint latency | Optimize processing / return 200 quickly |
| Duplicate notifications | Missing idempotency | Track delivery IDs, discard repeats |
