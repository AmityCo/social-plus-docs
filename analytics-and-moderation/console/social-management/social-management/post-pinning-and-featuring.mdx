# Post Pinning and Featuring

Pinning posts are a great way to control the visibility and accessibility of important content in your community feed. We provide two different actions when it comes to pinning posts:  &#x20;

* **Add to Community’s Pinned Collection:** Pin frequently referenced posts to a centralized location within your community, ensuring members have easy access. In our UIKit, pinned posts appear in the community's ‘Pinned’ tab.

* **Feature in Community:** Feature high-impact content within the community to ensure it remains prominently visible to community members. In our UIKit, community featured posts are pinned to the top of the community feed. Whether it’s announcing an upcoming event or highlighting guidelines, featuring a post keeps it in the spotlight. Only one post can be featured per community at a time, ideal for high-impact content.

You’ll only be able to pin a post in the community in which it was created. Posts that are pinned in a public community will be visible to all users, however only members will be able to comment and react to the post. For private communities, pinned posts will only be visible to members. \


Adding a post to a community’s pinned collection and featuring a post in the community are independent actions that can be used simultaneously.&#x20;

For example, you might want to add a detailed guideline post to the pinned collection to ensure members always have easy access to it. At the same time, you can feature the same post in the community during a crucial moment, such as when guidelines are first introduced, to ensure all members see them immediately. Once this period has passed, you can remove the post from being featured while it remains in the pinned collection for ongoing reference.

<Info>
Integration is required to use this feature. Our UIKit natively supports displaying pinned posts. For custom builds, developers have the flexibility to render pinned posts using our SDK. Read more about [SDK](broken-reference) & [UIKit](../../../../social-plus-uikit/uikit-4/) here.

### Add to Community’s Pinned Collection&#x20;

To make frequently referenced posts accessible in a central place for your members, you can add a post to the community’s pinned collection.  &#x20;

1. Navigate to “Communities” or “Posts” to search for the community where the post was created in&#x20;
2. Once you’ve located the post you’d like to pin, click on the pin icon in the \`Actions\` section on the right.

You can pin up to 20 posts per community, perfect for frequently referenced content, recurring weekly discussions, or any information that needs to be easily accessible. This is especially useful for content that doesn’t necessarily need to take front and center of the community feed but still requires quick access for your members.&#x20;

<Info>
&#x20;Only non-deleted posts can be pinned.

Posts added to your community’s pinned collection will appear in the ‘Pinned’ tab. In the pinned collection, posts are sorted from the most recently pinned. Reordering how pinned posts are sorted within the collection is not supported. Posts will appear in the order they were pinned, with the most recently pinned posts displayed first. &#x20;

If you want to remove a post from the community’s pinned collection, click the unpin icon.&#x20;

### Feature in Community

For posts that need maximum visibility, you can use the “Feature in Community” option to pin them to the top of your community’s feed, keeping them prominently displayed for all members.&#x20;

1. Navigate to “Communities” or “Posts” to search for the community where the post was created in.
2. Once you’ve located the post you’d like to feature, click on the star icon in the ‘Actions’ section on the right and select “Feature in this community”.

You can only have one community featured post per community at a time, making it ideal for high-impact announcements, ‘post of the week’, and spotlighting content that deserves special attention. This ensures that your community members see and engage with vital content.&#x20;

<Warning>
Only non-deleted posts can be featured in the community.
</Warning>

Community featured posts will appear in the “Featured” tab. If you’d like to remove a community featured post, click on the un-star icon and select “Remove community featured post”.\
