## Comment Thread Structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Displayed Data">
    Each comment shows:
    - Author avatar & username
    - Timestamp & last activity marker
    - Comment text content
    - Engagement counts (reactions, replies)
    - Identity indicator (Brand / User)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Threading & Order">
    - Top-level comments ordered chronologically (newest or standard order depending on configuration)
    - Replies nested under parent comment for context continuity
    - Reply counts surfaced to quickly identify active subthreads
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Engagement Signals">
    Use reaction & reply counts to surface:
    - Emerging discussions needing moderation
    - Popular threads for community amplification
    - Potential hotspots for policy enforcement
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flag Handling">
    - Flagged comments surface in thread with indicator
    - Prioritize review based on severity & volume
    - Clearing a flag removes it from escalation metrics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Moderation Actions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Reply">Engage constructively; de-escalate tension, clarify policy, or encourage participation.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Delete">Remove comments violating guidelines (harassment, spam, disallowed content). Action is immediate & irreversible.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Clear Flags">After reviewing, clear false or resolved flags to maintain signal integrity.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalate (Internal)">Document sensitive incidents externally if audit trails are required (e.g., legal/regulatory categories).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Monitor Patterns">Track users generating repeated borderline content; consider broader enforcement workflows if needed.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Deleted comments are not viewable post-removal. Capture rationale before deletion when policy requires an audit trail.</Warning>

## Replying & Engagement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Reply">Click reply icon under the target comment.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose Identity">Select Myself (admin user) or Brand (official account).</Step>
  <Step title="Compose Message">Keep response concise, neutral, and aligned with guidelines.</Step>
  <Step title="Publish">Send and verify it appears in correct thread.</Step>
</Steps>

### Identity Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Myself (Admin User)">
    Use for routine clarifications, community encouragement, light moderation nudges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand (Official)">
    Use for formal statements, policy clarifications, resolution confirmations, critical announcements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Switching Guidance">
    Avoid switching identities mid-thread unless escalating tone context (e.g., from informal to formal resolution follow-up).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>Brand profile requires prior configuration in Settings → Brand Settings.</Info>

## Quality & Tone Guidelines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Clarity">Use short sentences. Lead with resolution or key message. Avoid jargon.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Neutrality">Stay impartial especially in disputes. Do not take sides publicly prematurely.</Tab>
  <Tab title="De-escalation">Acknowledge concerns, restate guidelines, offer constructive next steps.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Brand Consistency">Match approved voice: professional, concise, empathetic when needed.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Audit Readiness">For sensitive removals, maintain internal notes (external system) referencing rationale.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monitoring & Metrics

Track:
- Comment volume per high-traffic posts
- Reaction-to-reply ratio (engagement depth)
- Flag rate (flags per 100 comments)
- Response latency (time to first moderator/admin reply)
- Recurring offenders (repeat policy friction)

<Info>Use metrics trends to refine staffing schedules and escalation thresholds.</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Operational Cadence">
    - Review high-activity posts at scheduled intervals.
    - Prioritize flagged + high-engagement threads.
    - Batch moderation actions to reduce context switching.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    - Apply deletion criteria uniformly.
    - Use saved internal templates for common responses (if available).
    - Avoid over-moderating constructive critique.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Community Health">
    - Encourage positive contributors with timely acknowledgment.
    - Address misinformation early with factual, sourced replies.
    - Track topics generating recurring friction for potential policy updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Risk Management">
    - Escalate threats, self-harm, or legal incidents per protocol.
    - Archive (externally) severe violation context before deletion.
    - Document patterns leading to account-level enforcement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Comment not appearing | Network delay / stale view | Refresh thread; confirm submission |
| Cannot switch to Brand | Brand not configured / permission | Configure Brand or adjust role |
| Reply posted under wrong identity | Identity not re-selected | Verify identity before sending |
| Flag won’t clear | Insufficient permission / state change | Confirm role & refresh thread |
| High duplicate spam | Automated/bot activity | Apply broader anti-spam measures / escalate |
| Reactions not updating | Cached metrics | Refresh or wait for sync cycle |
| Deleted comment inquiries | User confusion | Provide neutral explanation referencing guidelines |
