# Post Viewing and Management

The Posts & Comments page allows you to organize, monitor, and manage all posts and comments across your communities. This interface provides comprehensive tools for post moderation and oversight.

### Accessing Post Management

1. Navigate to "Posts & Comment" in the left sidebar menu
2. The post & Comment management page will display with filtering options and post status tabs

This page will show the posts attached to a given context. A context can be: an external content, a community or a user. For communities and users, it will be mandatory to input the respective ID. For example:&#x20;

1. To see all the external contents of an admin's network, simply choose "Content" from the filter bar.&#x20;
2. To see all the posts of a community's feed, choose "Community" and input the chosen community's ID or name.&#x20;
3. To see all the posts of a user's feed, choose "User" and input the chosen user's ID or display name.&#x20;
4. To see the post of a specific post's ID choose "Post" and input the chosen user's ID.&#x20;

There are options to filter posts and reveal only ones that are flagged, as well as deleting a post if admin's deem it to be necessary.
