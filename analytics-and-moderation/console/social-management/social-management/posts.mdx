## AI Content Quality Detection

social.plus now automatically evaluates post quality using AI-powered detection, giving you immediate visibility into which contributions meet your community's standards. Each post receives a quality label based on relevance, structure, clarity, and engagement potential—helping you quickly identify high-value content to feature or low-quality posts that need attention.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

### Getting Started with Quality Detection

<Info>
  **Feature Enablement Required**: AI Content Quality Detection is an advanced feature that must be enabled by our support team. Contact your account manager or [reach out to support](mailto:support@social.plus) to activate this feature for your application.
</Info>

#### Customizing Quality Definitions

Every application has unique standards for what makes content valuable. social.plus allows you to customize quality detection criteria to match your application's specific needs and culture.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Quality Definitions" icon="sliders">
    Work with our team to define the most suitable quality definitions for your application:

    - **Default Quality Definitions**: The content can be anything in social network. Add a bonus point for a review, reaction, tip, movie and lifestyle. The message should be clear and easy to understand, even if written casually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Continuous Refinement" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Quality detection improves over time as it learns from your application:

    - Share examples of posts you consider excellent or problematic
    - Provide feedback on scoring accuracy through our support team
    - Request periodic reviews to ensure criteria remain aligned with evolving application standards
    - Access reporting on quality trends to inform strategy adjustments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **Implementation Timeline**: After requesting enablement, our team will work with you to configure quality definitions.
</Note>

### Understanding Quality Labels

Each post displaying text content receives one of five quality labels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Excellent" icon="star">
    **Fully relevant, strongly written—clear, structured, expressive, and likely to engage.**

    These posts demonstrate exceptional quality with well-structured content that drives meaningful discussions. They're ideal candidates for featuring or pinning.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Clear, focused message aligned with community topics
    - Well-organized with proper formatting
    - Engaging tone that invites interaction
    - Comprehensive yet concise
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Good" icon="circle-check">
    **Relevant and well-written with minor room for improvement in clarity or structure.**

    Quality contributions that meet community standards. These posts are valuable but may lack the polish of excellent content.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Clear relevance to community
    - Generally well-structured
    - Minor formatting or clarity issues
    - Solid foundation for engagement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fair" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    **Moderately relevant or adequately written, but lacks depth or polish.**

    Acceptable contributions that don't violate guidelines but may not drive significant engagement.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Basic relevance maintained
    - Minimal structure or detail
    - Could benefit from elaboration
    - Meets minimum standards
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weak" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Low relevance or poorly written—unclear, unstructured, or minimally engaging.**

    These posts may require moderator review to determine if they should remain visible or if author guidance is needed.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Unclear purpose or relevance
    - Poor structure or formatting
    - Minimal effort or substance
    - Low engagement potential
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Broken" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Irrelevant, unintelligible, or severely lacking in quality—likely spam or off-topic.**

    Content that should be reviewed immediately for potential removal. Often indicates spam, off-topic content, or severe quality issues.

    **Characteristics:**
    - No clear relevance to community
    - Unintelligible or nonsensical
    - Possible spam or abuse
    - Requires immediate attention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **Text Content Only**: Quality detection analyzes text content exclusively. Posts containing only media (images, videos, files) without text will not display a quality label. Posts with both text and media are scored based on the text content.
</Note>

### Viewing Quality Labels

Quality labels appear automatically on posts throughout the Console:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User History - Posted Tab">
    View quality labels on all posts authored by a specific user to assess their overall contribution quality.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Posts & Comments Page - Posted Tab">
    See quality labels on all posted content across communities and contexts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hover for Details">
    Hover over any quality label to see a tooltip explaining what that score means and why it was assigned.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Quality labels are **not displayed** on Pending, Scheduled, Pinned, Global Featured, Community Featured, or Deleted tabs. They appear only in the Posted tab and User History.
</Info>

### Filtering by Content Quality

Use quality filtering to focus your moderation efforts where they matter most:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Quality Level">
    Filter by one quality level (e.g., "Excellent") to review top contributions for featuring opportunities.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Find excellent posts to feature globally or in communities
    - Identify weak or broken content requiring immediate review
    - Audit fair posts to provide author guidance
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multiple Quality Levels">
    Select multiple quality levels simultaneously to create custom review queues.

    **Example Workflows:**
    - Select "Excellent + Good" to find feature candidates
    - Select "Weak + Broken" to prioritize removal queue
    - Select "Fair + Weak" to identify posts needing author coaching
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Quality-First Review">
    Quality filters work independently—they cannot be combined with other filters (status, date range, flags).

    **Best Practice:**
    - Use quality filtering first to identify priority content
    - Then apply other filters in subsequent reviews
    - Combine with context filters (Community, User) for targeted audits
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Posted Tab">
    Go to Posts & Comments → Select your context (Community, User, Content) → Click **Posted** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Quality Filter">
    Click the **Quality** filter dropdown and select one or more quality levels.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Posts are displayed by recency (most recent first). Scroll to review all matching content.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Action">
    Feature excellent posts, review weak content for removal, or provide guidance to authors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Filtering Limitations:**
  - Quality filtering is available only in the **Posted** tab (excludes Pinned, Global Featured, Community Featured)
  - Cannot combine quality filters with other filter types
  - Deleted posts are excluded from quality filter results
</Warning>

### Quality-Driven Moderation Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Quality Review">
    **Morning Routine:**
    1. Filter by "Excellent" to identify featuring candidates
    2. Review top posts for community or global featuring
    3. Filter by "Broken + Weak" to catch quality issues
    4. Remove spam or guide authors to improve content

    **Time Savings:** Focus on extremes (best and worst) rather than reviewing all content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Community Health Audit">
    **Weekly Analysis:**
    1. Filter each community by quality levels
    2. Track ratio of Excellent/Good vs Weak/Broken posts
    3. Identify communities needing content guidelines
    4. Coach power users creating consistently weak content

    **Insight:** Communities with high "Fair" ratios may need clearer posting guidelines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Contribution Assessment">
    **User History Review:**
    1. Navigate to User context → User History → Posted tab
    2. Review quality distribution of user's posts
    3. Identify top contributors (consistent Excellent/Good)
    4. Provide feedback to users with consistent Weak/Broken scores

    **Recognition:** Use quality data to identify community champions for rewards programs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Featuring Strategy">
    **Strategic Visibility:**
    1. Filter by "Excellent" in high-traffic communities
    2. Review engagement metrics (reactions, comments) alongside quality
    3. Feature posts combining excellent quality with high engagement
    4. Track featured post performance to refine criteria

    **Optimization:** Quality + engagement = maximum community impact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality Label Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trust but Verify">
    Quality labels provide guidance, not absolute rules. Always review flagged content and use your judgment for edge cases.

    **Considerations:**
    - Cultural context and community norms
    - Technical content may appear "weak" but be highly valuable
    - Short announcements may score lower but serve clear purposes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Author Education">
    Use quality insights to coach community members on creating better content.

    **Approach:**
    - Share examples of "Excellent" posts as templates
    - Provide constructive feedback on "Weak" posts
    - Create community guidelines based on quality patterns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balanced Moderation">
    Don't remove content solely based on quality labels—focus on policy violations and community guidelines.

    **Guidelines:**
    - "Broken" posts → Review for spam/off-topic removal
    - "Weak" posts → Consider author guidance before removal
    - "Fair" posts → Generally acceptable, may improve over time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recognition Programs">
    Leverage quality data to identify and reward top contributors.

    **Ideas:**
    - Monthly highlights of users with consistent "Excellent" posts
    - Community badges for quality contributors
    - Feature "Post of the Week" based on quality + engagement
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **Privacy & Transparency**: Quality labels are visible only to administrators and moderators with appropriate permissions. Community members do not see quality scores on their own or others' posts.
</Note>
