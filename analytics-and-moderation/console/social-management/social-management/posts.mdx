- Member count
- Pending posts
- Flagged posts/comments
- Last activity timestamp
- Community type (Public / Private)

## Filtering & Discovery

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Filters">
    Use feed type, context selector, and status tabs to narrow results. Combine with flag toggle for urgent reviews.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Date & Range">
    Use range selectors (when available) to focus on recent surges or historical review windows.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalation Review">
    Filter by Requires approval + Flagged to prioritize intervention queues.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality Audits">
    Periodically scan Deleted and Flagged to validate moderation consistency.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Moderation Actions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approve / Reject">
    Approve pending posts from Requires approval tab. Reject (delete) content that violates guidelines. Document decisions where policy demands audit trails.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Feature & Pin">
    Elevate visibility (see Featuring & Pinning section). Combine community featuring with pinned collections for both spotlight + lasting access.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poll Control">
    Close polls early via the post action menu (⋮) if policy, abuse, or sufficient responses justify it. Closing locks further votes; results remain visible.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flags Workflow">
    Inspect flagged content promptly. Confirm valid reports, take action (remove, unfeature, unpin), or clear false positives.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Deletion & Restoration">
    Delete posts violating policy. Periodically review Deleted tab (if retention enabled) to ensure removals are consistent.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scheduling Oversight">
    Confirm scheduled posts timing (timezone, relevance). Adjust or cancel outdated scheduled content before publication.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Posts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Creation">In Posts & Comments, click Create Post or Create Poll Post.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose Destination">Set Share to: Community feed or User feed (other feeds may appear if configured).</Step>
  <Step title="Select Identity">Post as: Yourself or Brand (Brand must be configured in Settings → Brand Settings).</Step>
  <Step title="Compose Content">Add clear text, mention users with @ (≤30 mentions), attach media if applicable.</Step>
  <Step title="Review & Publish">Check formatting, attachments, identity, then Post or Schedule.</Step>
</Steps>

### Standard Post Guidelines

- Break long text into short paragraphs.
- Use mentions purposefully—avoid notification overload.
- Attach media to increase clarity (events, tutorials, updates).
- Support media types (per configuration) — images, videos, files (single media type per post up to 10 files).

### Brand Posting

<Info>Brand appearance and verification icon are configured by Super Admins. Use for authoritative announcements.</Info>

- Maintain consistent tone and formatting.
- Reserve for official communications, not casual chatter.
- Distinguish Brand vs personal admin voice to build trust.

## Poll Posts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Purpose">Gather structured feedback: feature prioritization, content preferences, scheduling, sentiment checks.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Question Crafting">Use neutral, concise questions. Avoid leading phrasing. Mention key stakeholders only if necessary.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Options">Provide 2–10 mutually exclusive, balanced options. Keep lengths similar. Remove redundancy.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Selection Type">Single (decisions) vs Multiple (preference gathering / prioritization).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Duration">Choose preset (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days) or custom (≤30 days). Align end time with decision cadence.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Early Closure">Close early only if: consensus reached, abuse occurring, deadline advanced, or policy violation present.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Media attachments are not currently supported in poll questions.</Warning>
