# Edit User Content with Change History

As a moderator, you can edit user posts and comments directly from the Console while maintaining a complete record of all changes. This feature helps you correct content while preserving transparency and accountability.

<Info>
**Safe Editing**: The original content is always preserved. You can view the complete edit history to see what changed, when, and who made the changes.
</Info>

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Permission-Based Access" icon="shield-check">Only admins with the <code>EDIT_POST_AND_COMMENT</code> permission can edit content.</Card>
  <Card title="Complete History" icon="history">Every edit is saved with the editor's name, timestamp, and optional reason.</Card>

## How It Works

The edit history system is designed to be simple and safe:

1. **Original Content Protected**: The original post or comment is never lost
2. **Every Change Tracked**: Each edit creates a new version with a timestamp
3. **Clear Audit Trail**: See who made each change and when
4. **Optional Edit Reasons**: Add notes explaining why content was edited
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: System keeps original + 10 most recent edits to save space

<Note>
Content that cannot be edited includes polls, stories, and scheduled posts.

## Understanding Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EDIT_POST_AND_COMMENT Permission">
    This permission allows you to edit the content of posts and comments. It's separate from other moderation permissions like delete or hide, ensuring only authorized admins can make content changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What You Can Edit">
    With this permission, you can change text content, add or remove attachments, and reorder images or files. You cannot edit polls, stories, or scheduled posts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting Permission">
    If you don't have this permission, contact your system administrator. They can add it to your admin role through the Console or admin API.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Editing Process

When you edit content, here's what happens:

1. **Open Editor**: Click the Edit button to open the editing interface
2. **Make Changes**: The editor shows the current content where you can:
   - Edit the text
   - Add new images or files
   - Remove existing attachments
   - Reorder attachments by dragging and dropping
3. **Add Edit Reason** (Optional): Explain why you're making the change (up to 300 characters)
4. **Save**: Click save to apply your changes
5. **Immediate Update**: The content updates right away for all users
6. **History Recorded**: Your edit is automatically saved to the history with your name and timestamp

<Tip>
**Edit Indicator**: After editing, the content will show an "Edited" badge that users can click to see it was modified by an admin.
</Tip>

## Viewing Edit History

Every piece of edited content has a complete history that you can review:

**What's Included in History:**
- **Original Version**: The content as it was first posted (always preserved)
- **Each Edit**: Every change made, including who made it and when
- **Edit Reasons**: Any explanations provided by editors
- **Attachment Changes**: What files were added, removed, or reordered

**How to View History:**
1. Look for the "Edited" badge on content
2. Click the History button or badge
3. Browse through all versions from newest to oldest
4. See exactly what changed between versions

<Info>
**History Retention**: The system keeps the original version plus the 10 most recent edits. If there are more than 10 edits, older versions are automatically removed to save storage space.
</Info>

## Managing Attachments

When editing content with images, videos, or files, you have full control over attachments:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding Attachments">
    Upload new images, videos, or files just like when creating new content. The new attachments will be added to the post or comment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Removing Attachments">
    Click the delete button on any attachment to remove it. Removed attachments will show as "Deleted in version X" when viewing older versions in the history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reordering Attachments">
    Drag and drop attachments to change their order. This creates a new version in the history showing the new arrangement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File Cleanup">
    When attachments are removed, the system automatically cleans up unused files to save storage space.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example: Attachment Changes Over Time

```
Original Post: [Image1, Image2, Image3, Video1, File1]
Edit 1: Remove Image1, Image2 → [Image3, Video1, File1]
Edit 2: Add Image4, remove File1 → [Image3, Video1, Image4]
Edit 3: Reorder → [Video1, Image3, Image4]
```

In the history, you can see exactly when each attachment was added, removed, or moved.

## Important Rules and Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content Still Gets Filtered">
    Even when you edit content as an admin, it still goes through the same content filtering as regular posts. Bad words and prohibited content will be blocked.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot Edit These Content Types">
    You cannot edit polls, stories, or scheduled posts. These content types don't support editing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Reason Length">
    Edit reasons are limited to 300 characters. Keep your explanations concise and clear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Editors">
    If multiple admins edit the same content at the same time, the last person to save wins. All edits are still saved in the history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="History Limits">
    Only the original version plus the 10 most recent edits are kept. Older edits are automatically removed to save space.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Admins

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Add Edit Reasons">
    When making changes, add a brief explanation in the edit reason field. This helps other admins understand why changes were made and maintains transparency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Make Thoughtful Edits">
    Avoid making multiple small edits in quick succession. Try to make all your changes at once to keep the edit history clean and meaningful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Before Saving">
    Double-check your changes before saving, especially when editing highly visible or sensitive content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Edit Activity">
    Regularly review who has edit permissions and what content is being edited to ensure the feature is being used appropriately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Safety

<Warning>
**Admin Access Only**: Content editing is a powerful feature that should only be available to trusted administrators. Never share admin credentials or tokens with unauthorized users.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Secure Authentication">
    All edits require proper admin authentication. The system automatically verifies your permissions before allowing any changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete Audit Trail">
    Every edit is permanently recorded with your admin ID, timestamp, and reason. This ensures full accountability for all content changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Protection">
    Edit history only stores the same information that's already visible in posts and comments. No additional sensitive data is collected.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't see the Edit button">
    Make sure your admin role has the <code>EDIT_POST_AND_COMMENT</code> permission. Contact your system administrator to add this permission if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit history is missing older versions">
    This is normal. The system only keeps the original version plus the 10 most recent edits. Older versions are automatically removed to save storage space.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attachment shows as 'Deleted'">
    This means the attachment was removed in a later edit. You can see it in older versions but it's no longer part of the current content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My edit was overwritten">
    If another admin edited the same content at the same time, their changes may have overwritten yours. Check the edit history to see all changes and consider making your edit again if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't edit certain posts">
    Polls, stories, and scheduled posts cannot be edited. Only regular text posts and comments support editing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
