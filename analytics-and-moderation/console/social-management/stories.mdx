# Stories

### Overview&#x20;

In the "Stories" menu, you can create new stories, view a list of active, expired, and scheduled stories created in your communities, and delete stories. To find a community, search by its name or community ID, and you'll see all the stories, both active and expired, that have been posted there, as well as a list of stories that have been scheduled for publishing.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can navigate to "Communities", select your desired community, and view the stories posted in that community.&#x20;

### Create Stories&#x20;

To create stories, click on the `+` Create Story button.&#x20;

Select the community you'd like to share your stories to, and then upload your media. We currently support creating image and video stories. Up to 10 media files can be uploaded at a time.&#x20;

Each image file uploaded can be up to 1GB in size. Video files can be uploaded as long as they are less than 2GB in size and do not exceed the maximum duration set for video stories. By default, our platform supports video stories with a maximum duration of 90 seconds. However, this duration can be customized via [API](https://apidocs.amity.co/#/Network%20Setting/put_api_v3_network_settings_feed_setting) to better suit your specific needs. Once you've uploaded your media, you can see an approximate preview of how the stories would look like in your app.&#x20;

When creating your stories, you'll be able to reorder the way in which your stories will appear. This is particularly useful when each story follows a sequential narrative. You'll also be able to add a link for each story. If you've enabled URL whitelisting, any link that you'd like to add to your story needs to be whitelisted first.&#x20;

Once your stories are ready, you can choose to publish them immediately or schedule them for a future time. You can schedule stories to be published at least 1 hour from the current time and up to 30 days in advance. All media uploaded will be published together as individual stories, following the order you have set.

### View Stories

Any stories you've created or scheduled in your community can be found in the Stories menu. Alternatively, you can access this via Communities. The number shown in the "Stories" card under a specific community indicates the number of active and expired stories the community currently has. It does not include scheduled stories and deleted stories. &#x20;

* **Expired tab:** Shows stories that have expired&#x20;
* **Scheduled tab:** Shows all scheduled stories&#x20;

Within the Active and Expired tabs, you'll be able to:&#x20;

* **View Stories:** See the actual image or video content posted&#x20;
* **Hyperlinks**: Access any included hyperlinks&#x20;
* **Comments:** Check the number of comments, including any flagged comments&#x20;
* **Reactions:** View the number of reactions to the story&#x20;
* **Manage Stories:**&#x20;
  * Delete stories&#x20;
  * Clear any flags (reports) from stories&#x20;

In the Scheduled tab, you'll be able to see a list of scheduled stories sorted by latest scheduled date. You'll also be able to see hyperlinks added, and delete scheduled stories. Once scheduled stories have been published, they'll show up in the "Active" tab.&#x20;

Please note that you currently cannot view deleted stories.&#x20;
