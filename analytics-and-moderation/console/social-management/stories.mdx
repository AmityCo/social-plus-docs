  <Accordion title="Media Requirements">
    - Images: up to 1 GB each
    - Videos: under 2 GB, ≤ configured maximum duration (default 90s)

    - Single creation batch = ordered Story sequence for narrative impact
  </Accordion>

    Drag to reorder before publishing / scheduling.
    Use sequencing for: event recaps, multi-step tutorials, campaign countdowns.
  </Accordion>

    Add an optional hyperlink per Story item.
    If URL whitelisting is enabled, destination must be pre-approved or link cannot be saved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduling">
    - Earliest schedule time: ≥ 1 hour from now
    - Latest schedule time: up to 30 days ahead
    - All items in the batch follow the same release time and then display in the order configured
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview & Quality">
    Console preview approximates in‑app experience (device variances may apply). Validate crop, readability, caption relevance, and link integrity before finalizing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
