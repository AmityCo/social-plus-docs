The Communities section of the Console centralizes everything: creation, categorization, activity oversight, membership governance, and fine‑grained permissions.

    Categories cluster communities by theme to enhance discovery.

      "Only admins can post" and "Approve member posts" are mutually exclusive.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Commenting Permissions (Stories)">

    - Start with open posting \+ approvals for new communities
    - Introduce Only-admin mode for broadcast / compliance spaces
    - Monitor flag ratios: flags per 100 posts as drift indicator
    - Periodically audit moderator role assignments
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Growth & Discovery">
    - Curate category landing pages with representative communities
