## Accessing User History

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Manage Users">Navigate: Users → Manage Users.</Step>
  <Step title="Select User">Click any user row to open Social History panel.</Step>
  <Step title="Alternate Paths">Click username from Posts & Comments or Community Member list.</Step>
  <Step title="Review Snapshot">Begin with headline metrics before deep dive.</Step>
</Steps>

## Snapshot Metrics

Key indicators at top:
- Name, follower / following counts, global role
- Active user-level flags (auto-updates when cleared)
- Totals: posts, comments, reactions, communities joined
- Active flagged posts & comments count (decrements as flags cleared)
- Global bans & community bans counts
- Quick actions: change role, global ban/unban, copy user ID

{/* Removed missing image: User Statistics Panel */}

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Posts & Comments">
    Filter by feed (User / Community), status (Flagged, Non-Flagged, Deleted), sort by Created Date / Last Activity. Action: delete content, clear flags. Provides separate totals for posts vs comments & replies.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reactions">
    View all reactions (posts & comments) from Nov 28, 2024 onward. Filter by Community feed vs User feed. Sort by Reaction Date. Inspect target content, copy IDs, or remove underlying content if policy violated.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Communities">
    Lists joined (active/deleted), left, banned, removed (tracking removed state starting Dec 19, 2024). Shows per-community counts (posts / comments / reactions). Actions: community ban, unban, remove. Assess spread & influence concentration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Moderation History">
    Chronological log: Ban, Community Ban, Removed (post Dec 19, 2024), plus counts summary. Supports pattern detection (recurring infractions, escalation thresholds).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Interpretation Framework

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Engagement Density">High comments vs low posts may indicate conversational contributor; high reactions with low authored content may signal passive engager or reaction spam.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flag Pattern Analysis">Clustered flags in narrow time windows suggest episodic behavior; distributed flags indicate chronic issues.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cross-Community Influence">Multiple high-activity communities = broader impact; concentrated activity aids targeted intervention.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moderation Escalation">Escalate from content deletion → temporary community ban → global ban if violation severity escalates or cross-community spread emerges.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Decision Playbooks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low-Risk Noise">Minor isolated flags; advise user via response, monitor trend.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Repeat Local Violations">Pattern in 1 community → community ban period, educate, reassess.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Cross-Community Abuse">Flags across several communities → consider global temporary ban + review historical moderation notes.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalation Case">Severe violation (threats, explicit abuse) → immediate global ban + document for compliance.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Rehabilitation">Declining violation trend post-warning → reduce restrictions; track next 30 days.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Insight | Action Trigger |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Flags / 30 days | Current behavioral risk | Sudden spike vs baseline |
| Flag clearance rate | Moderator responsiveness | Low clearance → adjust staffing |
| Communities engaged | Breadth of influence | High + rising flags → broader review |
| Reaction-to-post ratio | Engagement style | Extreme imbalance → review for spam |
| Ban recurrence interval | Escalation need | Short intervals → stronger sanction |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Effective Assessment">
    - Start with snapshot metrics before deep scroll.
    - Correlate flags with content type & community.
    - Validate if spikes align with platform events (launches, campaigns).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistent Moderation">
    - Reference prior actions to avoid double-penalizing.
    - Apply same thresholds across communities.
    - Document rationale for escalations externally when required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Community Impact">
    - Identify positive contributors for recognition programs.
    - Track disengagement after sanctions (potential churn risk).
    - Use distribution of contributions to guide community staffing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Missing reactions pre Nov 28 2024 | Historical limit | Data collection started then; no retro import |
| Removed not showing pre Dec 19 2024 | Feature availability start | Only tracked from release date |
| Flags count mismatch | Recently cleared / delayed sync | Refresh or wait sync cycle |
| Cannot change global role | Permission scope lacking | Adjust admin role privileges |
| Ban option disabled | Already globally banned | Unban first to reapply variant action |
| Community missing from list | Deleted & purged / permission scope | Confirm retention policy / scope |
