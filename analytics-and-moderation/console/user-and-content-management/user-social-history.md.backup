# User Social History

The User Social History feature provides community managers, moderators, and admins with a comprehensive view of user activity across all communities. This feature helps ensure informed, transparent, and consistent moderation decisions while unlocking valuable insights into user behavior.

With this feature, you can now:

**Analyze user statistics**: Instantly see a user’s statistics (total posts, comments, reactions, and community participation), alongside flagged content and past moderation actions, to quickly assess their overall impact and behavioral patterns before exploring the user history details.

**Review a detailed activity log**: Access a complete timeline of user posts, comments, and interactions (including flagged and deleted content) to gain full context behind user activity.

**Understand a user’s engagement levels**: View the communities a user is part of, including their role in each, to assess their influence and participation.

**Track past moderation actions**: See previous moderation actions taken on a user over time to detect behavioral patterns and ensure fai&#x72;**,** data-driven decisions.

**Determine the right level of moderation**: From deleting content to banning users, ensure each action is appropriate based on a user’s full history.

This feature is designed to help moderators respond faster, improve decision accuracy, and create a more transparent and harmonious community.
