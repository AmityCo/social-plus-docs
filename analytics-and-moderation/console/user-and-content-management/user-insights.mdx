## Overview

Community managers face a fundamental challenge: identifying who truly adds value versus who just adds noise. High activity doesn't always mean high impact. A user rapidly posting low-quality content creates volume without value, while thoughtful contributors creating insightful posts may stay hidden in the metrics.

This feature solves that problem with two intelligent scoring systems:

- **Contribution Level**: Transparent points-based scoring that rewards meaningful actions (posts, comments, reactions)
- **Content Quality Level**: Average quality score of all user-generated posts

Together, these scores provide a complete picture of each user's impact, helping you make data-driven decisions about recognition, moderation, and community growth.

## Understanding Contribution Levels

Contribution Level measures **how actively** a user participates in your community through posts, comments, and reactions. It's calculated using a transparent points-based system over the last 30 days.

### Scoring System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Points Breakdown">
    Each action earns points based on effort and impact:
    - **Create a post**: 10 points
    - **Write a comment**: 5 points
    - **Add a reaction**: 1 point

    <Note>
    Deleted posts and comments are automatically excluded from scoring to ensure accuracy.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contribution Level Labels">
    Points accumulate to determine your contribution level:

    | Label | Points Range | Meaning |
    |-------|--------------|---------|
    | **Very High** | 501+ points | Power contributor driving significant engagement |
    | **High** | 201-500 points | Active contributor with consistent participation |
    | **Medium** | 51-200 points | Regular contributor with steady activity |
    | **Low** | 1-50 points | Emerging contributor, just getting started |
    | **None** | 0 points | No contribution activity in the last 30 days |

    <Tip>
    **Pro Tip**: The 30-day rolling window means contribution levels naturally reflect current engagement, not historical activity.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customizable Weights (API)">
    Enterprise customers can adjust point weights via API to match your community's unique dynamics:

    - Emphasize posts if you value original content creation
    - Increase comment weights to reward discussion participation
    - Adjust reaction values if engagement style differs

    <Info>
    Contact your account manager to configure custom weighting for your application.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Content Quality Levels

Content Quality Level measures **how well** a user creates content, based on the average quality score of their posts. This helps identify users who consistently produce valuable, well-structured content versus those posting spam or low-effort material.

### Quality Assessment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Quality is Calculated">
    Content Quality is determined by:

    1. **Individual Post Scores**: Each post receives a quality score (based on AI content moderation and community signals)
    2. **User Average**: The user's Content Quality Level is the average of all their post scores
    3. **Active Posts Only**: Deleted posts are excluded from the calculation

    <Note>
    Only posts are evaluated for quality—comments and reactions don't factor into this score. This focuses the metric on substantive content creation.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Quality Level Labels">
    Quality scores map to clear, intuitive labels:

    | Label | Description | Typical Characteristics |
    |-------|-------------|-------------------------|
    | **Excellent** | Highest quality content | Insightful, well-structured, valuable posts |
    | **Good** | Above-average quality | Solid content with clear value |
    | **Fair** | Acceptable quality | Adequate posts, room for improvement |
    | **Weak** | Below-average quality | Low-effort or problematic content |
    | **Broken** | Violates community standards | Spam, inappropriate, or harmful content |
    | **No Posts** | User hasn't created posts | New users or comment-only participants |

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Insights in Manage Users

### Display and Tooltips

Both Contribution Level and Content Quality Level are displayed prominently on:

- **Manage Users Page**: See labels for all users at a glance
- **User History Panel**: View scores when investigating individual users

**Hover for Details**: Hovering over any label shows a tooltip explaining:
- How the score is calculated in general
- The specific threshold or range for that label
- What the label means for user behavior

### Sorting Capabilities

Click column headers to sort the user list and quickly identify specific segments:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sort by Contribution Level">
    **Two sorting options**:
    - **Highest First**: Very High → High → Medium → Low → None (identify top contributors)
    - **Lowest First**: None → Low → Medium → High → Very High (find inactive or low-engagement users)

    <Tip>
    Use "Lowest First" to identify users who may be disengaging or need onboarding support.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sort by Content Quality Level">
    **Two sorting options**:
    - **Highest First**: Excellent → Good → Fair → Weak → Broken → No Posts (surface quality creators)
    - **Lowest First**: Broken → Weak → Fair → Good → Excellent → No Posts (flag problem content)

    <Warning>
    "Lowest First" quality sorting is critical for moderation—it surfaces users creating problematic content.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secondary Sorting">
    When multiple users have the same score, they're sorted by **Last Created Date** (most recent first) for consistent, predictable ordering
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pagination Handling">
    Sorting applies to the **full result set**, not just the current page. This ensures accurate top/bottom rankings across your entire user base.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Advanced Filtering

Focus on specific user segments by filtering on Contribution Level or Content Quality Level—or both together:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contribution Level Filter">
    Select a single contribution level to view only users at that engagement tier:
    - **Very High** (🔥): Your power users
    - **High** (💪): Strong contributors
    - **Medium** (⚡): Regular participants
    - **Low** (🌱): Emerging members
    - **None** (👻): Inactive users

    **Example Use Cases**:
    - Filter for "Very High" to identify users for a rewards program
    - Filter for "None" to find disengaged users for re-engagement campaigns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Quality Level Filter">
    Select a single quality level to view only users creating content at that standard:
    - **Excellent** (✅): Top-quality creators
    - **Good** (👍): Above-average contributors
    - **Fair** (😐): Acceptable content
    - **Weak** (👎): Below-average quality
    - **Broken** (🚫): Policy violations
    - **No Posts** (📝): Non-posting users

    **Example Use Cases**:
    - Filter for "Excellent" to identify content for featured sections
    - Filter for "Broken" to review users for potential bans
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combined Filters (AND Logic)">
    Apply both filters simultaneously to find precise user segments:
    - **High Contribution + Excellent Quality**: Your most valuable members
    - **Very High Contribution + Weak Quality**: High-volume, low-value posters (potential spam)
    - **Low Contribution + Good Quality**: Rising stars with potential
    - **None Contribution + No Posts**: Completely inactive users

    <Info>
    Filters work together using AND logic: results must match BOTH the selected contribution level AND content quality level.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter Limitations">
    <Warning>
    **Important**: Contribution and Quality filters cannot be combined with:
    - User status filters (Flagged / Non-Flagged)
    - Search by user ID or name

    If you need to search for a specific user, apply the search first, then use insights on the User History panel.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty States">
    If no users match your selected filters, you'll see a clear empty state message guiding you to adjust your criteria.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Strategic Use Cases

    4. Track progression over time

    **Impact**: Develop future power users, increase engagement
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Re-engagement Campaign">
    **Goal**: Bring back inactive valuable users

    **Workflow**:
    1. Filter for Contribution Level = "None"
    2. Cross-reference historical data (if available) for formerly active users
    3. Targeted outreach or incentives

    **Impact**: Reduce churn, revive dormant community members
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Spam Detection">
    **Goal**: Identify high-volume, low-quality posters

    **Workflow**:
    1. Filter for Contribution Level = "Very High" or "High"
    2. Filter for Content Quality = "Weak" or "Broken"
    3. Review post patterns for spam
    4. Take enforcement action

    **Impact**: Reduce noise, maintain content standards
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Review Cadence">
    Establish a consistent schedule for reviewing user insights:
    - **Weekly**: Check for new "Broken" quality users requiring immediate action
    - **Bi-weekly**: Identify top contributors for recognition
    - **Monthly**: Analyze trends (are quality scores improving? Is contribution concentrated?)
    - **Quarterly**: Review overall community health and adjust strategies

    <Tip>
    Set calendar reminders for these reviews to maintain consistency and catch issues early.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine with Other Data">
    User insights are most powerful when combined with:
    - **User History**: See the specific content behind the scores
    - **Analytics Dashboard**: Track trends over time
    - **Moderation Feed**: Cross-reference with flagged content
    - **Community Engagement Metrics**: Understand context of scores

    Don't rely on scores alone—investigate the underlying behavior.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Act on Insights">
    Insights only create value when they drive action:
    - **Reward**: Create recognition programs for top performers
    - **Moderate**: Address low-quality content creators promptly
    - **Engage**: Reach out to promising mid-tier contributors
    - **Support**: Provide resources to help users improve
    - **Adjust**: If scores don't match expectations, review community guidelines or score weights
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Context">
    Scores provide objective data, but context matters:
    - New communities may have many "Low" contributors still finding their voice
    - Niche communities may naturally have lower overall activity
    - Seasonal trends may affect contribution levels
    - Content quality standards vary by community type

    Use scores as a starting point, not the final word.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transparency with Users">
    Consider sharing how contribution and quality are measured:
    - Include scoring criteria in community guidelines
    - Explain what behaviors earn points
    - Set clear content quality standards
    - Show users their own scores (if your app supports it)

    Transparency helps users understand how to contribute meaningfully.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Metrics to Monitor

Track these key indicators to understand and optimize your community health:

| Metric | What It Tells You | Action Trigger |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Distribution of Contribution Levels** | Engagement health across tiers | High concentration in "None" → improve onboarding |
| **% Users with "Excellent" Quality** | Content quality baseline | Low % → review guidelines, improve education |
| **Very High + Broken Users** | Potential spam or abuse | Any occurrence → immediate investigation |
| **Low/None + Excellent Users** | Untapped potential | Rising count → nurture these emerging stars |
| **Trend: Contribution Levels** | Growing or shrinking engagement | Declining high levels → investigate causes |
| **Trend: Quality Levels** | Improving or degrading content | Degrading quality → strengthen moderation |
| **Top 10% Contributor Concentration** | Community dependence risk | Too concentrated → diversify engagement |
| **Broken Quality Rate** | Moderation effectiveness | Rising rate → review moderation processes |

<Info>
**Benchmarking**: Compare your metrics month-over-month and against similar communities to identify trends and set realistic goals.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scores seem inaccurate">
    **Symptoms**: User score doesn't match expected behavior

    **Possible Causes**:
    - Score reflects last 30 days only (not historical activity)
    - Deleted content excluded from calculation
    - Recent activity hasn't updated yet (allow time for sync)

    **Resolution**:
    1. Open User History to verify specific posts/comments
    2. Check date range of activity
    3. Confirm no recent bulk deletions
    4. Allow 5-10 minutes for score recalculation after new activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Label not displaying">
    **Symptoms**: Missing contribution or quality label, or error message shown

    **Possible Causes**:
    - Score calculation error (backend issue)
    - User data incomplete or corrupted
    - Permission issue

    **Resolution**:
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Check console for error details (if technical admin)
    3. Verify user account status (active, not deleted)
    4. Contact support if error persists across multiple users
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tooltip not appearing">
    **Symptoms**: Hovering over label doesn't show explanation

    **Possible Causes**:
    - Browser caching issue
    - Tooltip data not loaded

    **Resolution**:
    1. Refresh page (clear cache if needed)
    2. Try different browser
    3. Verify internet connection
    4. If persistent, report as UI bug
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filters not working">
    **Symptoms**: Filter selection doesn't update user list, or shows unexpected results

    **Possible Causes**:
    - Conflict with search or status filters
    - No users match criteria (empty state)
    - Filter sync delay

    **Resolution**:
    1. Clear any search queries or status filters first
    2. Verify filter selection is correct (check dropdown)
    3. Try single filter before combining
    4. Refresh page if results seem stale
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sorting not functioning">
    **Symptoms**: Clicking sort doesn't reorder list, or order seems wrong

    **Possible Causes**:
    - Active filters limiting result set
    - Secondary sort (by date) creating confusion
    - Cached sort state

    **Resolution**:
    1. Note that users with same score sort by date
    2. Clear filters and try sorting again
    3. Refresh page to reset sort state
    4. Verify pagination—sorting applies across all pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't combine filters as expected">
    **Symptoms**: Want to use contribution + quality + flagged status together

    **Explanation**: This is a current limitation—insights filters work independently from search and status filters.

    **Workaround**:
    1. Apply contribution + quality filters to narrow list
    2. Manually scan for flagged users (flagged indicator still visible)
    3. OR: Filter for flagged users first, then check scores in User History individually

    <Info>
    This limitation ensures filter logic remains clear and predictable. Future releases may expand filter combinations.
