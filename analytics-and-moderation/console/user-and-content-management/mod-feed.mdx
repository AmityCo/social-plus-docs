## Review Workflow Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High-Severity First">Filter by report reasons (e.g., abuse, threats) → Sort by Flag count → Delete violations → Clear false positives.</Tab>
  <Tab title="AI Assistance">Use AI mod reasons to pre-group similar infractions → Bulk evaluate for consistency.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Attachment Focus">Advanced Filter → Attachments: Videos / Files → Prioritize for manual safety review.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Backlog Reduction">Sort by Oldest first → Work sequentially → Move to Latest first for fresh queue scan.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Moderator Audit">Reviewed tab → Filter by Moderator Name → Spot consistency gaps.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Decision Criteria

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delete vs Clear Flag">
    - Delete when content violates policy & removal improves safety.
    - Clear flag when content is compliant or already addressed contextually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flag Count Weighting">Higher counts = urgency, but still verify for mass-report brigading.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Thread Context">Always open parent thread for comments before deletion to avoid losing conversational coherence.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Media Evaluation">Prioritize video & file attachments for manual verification if policy sensitive.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Metrics & Monitoring

| Metric | Insight | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Average time to resolution | Workflow speed | Reduce queue switching if slow |
| Flags cleared vs deleted ratio | Content quality baseline | High delete ratio → education / prevention needed |
| Re-flag rate (same user/content) | Effectiveness of prior decisions | Escalate chronic sources |
| Moderator action distribution | Team load balance | Reassign to reduce bottlenecks |
| False positive rate | Report accuracy | Improve reporting guidelines / AI tuning |

<Info>Track trends weekly; adjust staffing and escalation policies based on sustained shifts.</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Efficient Review">
    - Pre-filter by highest risk reasons first.
    - Batch similar content types.
    - Use sorting shifts (Oldest → Latest) to prevent stale backlog.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team Coordination">
    - Use Reviewed tab for spot audits.
    - Align on deletion criteria to prevent uneven enforcement.
    - Rotate high-intensity queues to mitigate reviewer fatigue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality & Fairness">
    - Validate contextual thread before removal.
    - Confirm multi-report events are genuine (avoid brigading effect).
    - Provide internal rationale for ambiguous decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Item reappears after clear | New flag submitted | Re-evaluate & document edge cases |
| Slow loading filters | High dataset / network latency | Narrow filters; retry; check connectivity |
| Moderator missing in filter | No actions recorded in window | Expand date scope or verify permissions |
| Wrong sort order | Cached state | Reapply sort or refresh page |
| AI reason absent | Model confidence threshold not met | Proceed with manual evaluation |
| High false positives | Over-broad report reason usage | Educate users / refine categories |
