| Action             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update global role | Change the role of the user                                               |
| Global ban user    | Kick the user from all channels. Then ban the user from accessing the SDK |
| Global unban user  | Unban the user from accessing the SDK                                     |

In changing a user's role, admin can either promote a member to a moderator role or demote a moderator to a member role.&#x20;

There is no limit to the number of moderators a community can have. This means that if there are hundreds of users in the community, all of them can be moderators. However, every community must have at least one moderator. Thus, the sole remaining moderator in the community cannot be demoted to a member.&#x20;

For more information on how to change a user's role, refer to [Moderation, Roles & Privileges](../moderation-roles-and-privileges.md#change-user-role).

### Admin User Management <a href="#admin-user-management" id="admin-user-management"></a>

Admins are able to see all current Admin accounts on the SDK as well as create new Admin accounts. The username that is selected will be used as the login name. The display name is the name that users will see when the Admin broadcasts a message.‌

## Blocklist Management <a href="#blocklist-management" id="blocklist-management"></a>

Admins are able to view and manage a list of all blocked expressions from this tab.‌

Blocked expressions can either be exact or partial matches. This choice of behavior needs to be defined when an admin adds an expression to the list.‌

Admins can also set the auto mute period (in milliseconds) for when a user uses a blocked expression.‌

#### Adding blocked expressions via API

Adding blocked expressions in bulk can be done using the post [/api/blacklist/records](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Admin/post_api_v2_blacklist_records) API. Here is the format:

```
{
  "regexs": [
    "expression1_string", "expression2_string", "expression3_string"
  ],
  "isMatchExactWord": true
}
```

#### Model description

<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th width="179.33333333333334">Data Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>regexs</code></td><td><code>Array.&#x3C;string></code></td><td>Blocked expressions to add to the block list</td></tr><tr><td><code>isMatchExactWord</code></td><td><code>Boolean</code></td><td><p><code>true</code>: will block if an exact match is found</p><p></p><p><code>false</code>: will block even if the expression is just a subset</p><p>Example: </p><p>Expression: "hell"</p><p>Will block: "hell", "hello", "shell", "seashells", etc...</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Allowlist Management <a href="#allowlist-management" id="allowlist-management"></a>

Admins can view and manage a list of all allowed links from this tab.&#x20;

Admin can add links to the allow list and only the links in the list will be allowed. All other links not in the list will be blocked. By default, link restriction is enabled, thus, all links will be blocked.&#x20;

You can enable/disable this feature by toggling the on and off button.
