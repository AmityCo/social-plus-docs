<Info>
  Organize your user base with custom tags that make segmentation, search, and bulk operations effortless. Tag Management lets you create labeled categories — from "Verified ✅" to "New Joiner" — and assign them to users directly or in bulk, so you can filter, track, and act on specific groups instantly.

## Overview

As your community grows, managing users at scale requires more than just names and roles. Tag Management provides a flexible labeling system that lets you categorize users by any criteria meaningful to your organization — expertise areas, membership tiers, geographic regions, behavioral segments, or program participation.

Tags appear directly in the **Manage Users** table, can be used as filters to narrow down user lists, and are visible on individual tag detail pages where you can see and manage all assigned users at a glance.
