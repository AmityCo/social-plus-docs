## Moderation Philosophy

### **Layered Approach**
Social+ Console implements a multi-layered moderation strategy:

1. **Preventive**: AI filters catch inappropriate content before publication
2. **Reactive**: Community reporting enables quick response to violations
3. **Review**: Human moderators handle complex cases requiring judgment
4. **Appeal**: Fair process for users to contest moderation decisions

### **Balance & Fairness**
- **Proportionate Response**: Match moderation actions to violation severity
- **Due Process**: Provide clear reasoning and appeal opportunities
- **Consistency**: Apply rules equally across all community members
- **Transparency**: Communicate policies and decisions clearly
