## Permission Management

### Setting Up Edit Permissions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console Configuration">
    ### Admin Role Permissions

    **To View Permissions:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Admin Roles">
        Go to **Settings** → **Admin Roles** in the Console

    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    ### Permission Assignment Guidelines

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Role Design Principles">
        **Separation of Duties:**
        - Create distinct roles for different moderation tasks
        - Separate editing from deletion and banning powers
        - Use "Edit posts and comments" for content refinement
        - Use "Manage posts and comments" for full content lifecycle

        **Principle of Least Privilege:**
        - Grant only necessary permissions for each role
        - Review permissions regularly
        - Audit role usage patterns
        - Remove unused or excessive permissions
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Team Structure">
        **Recommended Role Hierarchy:**

        1. **Content Editors**: Edit permissions only
        2. **Community Moderators**: Edit + basic moderation
        3. **Senior Moderators**: Edit + full moderation
        4. **Administrators**: All permissions

        **Scaling Considerations:**
        - Small teams: Fewer, broader roles
        - Large teams: More specialized roles
        - Global teams: Regional role assignments
        - Contractor teams: Limited permission sets
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Compliance & Auditing">
        **Audit Requirements:**
        - Log all permission changes
        - Review edit actions monthly
        - Track editor performance metrics
        - Maintain permission documentation

        **Regulatory Considerations:**
        - Document edit reason requirements
        - Establish edit approval workflows
        - Define retention policies for change history
        - Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance

## Validation & Error Handling

### Content Validation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Block Words">
    ### Block Word Detection

    The system automatically validates edited content against your configured block word list before saving.

    **How It Works:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Block Word Detection">
        System scans edited content for configured block words
      </Step>
      <Step title="Error Display">
        Clear error message indicates which words triggered the block
      </Step>
      <Step title="User Correction">
        Moderator modifies content to remove or replace blocked terms
      </Step>
      <Step title="Re-validation">
        System re-checks content upon next save attempt
      </Step>
      <Step title="Successful Save">
        Content saves once all validation checks pass
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    **Important**: Block word validation applies to edited content even though moderators are editing. This ensures policy consistency and prevents accidental policy violations.
