<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel States & Icons">
    - Standard (active)
    - Deleted: Gray trash icon (visible to admins only)
    - Muted: Mute icon (all members read-only)
    - Stopped: Gray stop icon (force-closed; members removed)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Channel Actions Overview

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mute / Unmute">Temporarily suspend new member messages (read-only). Use for cooling-off periods or announcement-only phases.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Stop Channel">Immediately close channel and remove all members. Use for irreversible shutdown (archival or policy breach).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Delete Channel">Hide from non-admin users (soft delete). Still visible to admins with gray trash icon for oversight/audit.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Notification Modes">Default (all subscribed), Silent (suppress all), Subscribe (only opted-in). Adjust to control noise & relevance.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Privacy (Community Type)">Public = discoverable; Private = invite-only. Only applies to Community channel type.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Dialog">Channels → + (Create) button.</Step>
  <Step title="Select Type">Choose Community, Live, or Broadcast.</Step>
  <Step title="Define Identity">Set Channel ID & Display Name (member-visible).</Step>
  <Step title="Set Privacy (Community)">Choose Public or Private.</Step>
  <Step title="Mute Option">Pre-mute if staging content before opening.</Step>
  <Step title="Notification Mode">Pick Default, Silent, or Subscribe based on expected activity volume.</Step>
  <Step title="Create">Confirm settings and create channel.</Step>
</Steps>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-05-09 at 11.21.06.png" alt="Create Channel Button" /></figure>
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-05-09 at 11.23.41.png" alt="Channel Creation Dialog" /></figure>

<Info>Use Silent mode for high-volume announcement channels where you want manual opt-in later; use Subscribe mode to reduce irrelevant push volume platform-wide.</Info>

## Deleting / Stopping a Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Channel">Select target from list.</Step>
  <Step title="Settings Panel">Navigate to Settings section.</Step>
  <Step title="Action Choice">Decide: Stop (immediate closure) vs Delete (hide from end users).</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">Execute action; verify state icon updates.</Step>
</Steps>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-05-09 at 11.51.28.png" alt="Delete Channel Interface" /></figure>

<Warning>Stopping a channel forcibly disconnects members. Deleting keeps history accessible to admins but hidden from users.</Warning>

## Managing Channel Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Members Tab">Inside channel, select Members.</Step>
  <Step title="Locate User">Search or scroll through membership list.</Step>
  <Step title="Apply Action">Mute, Ban, Change Role, or Remove.</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Changes">Verify icon/state updates (e.g., ban badge).</Step>
</Steps>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-11-12 at 4.45.04 PM.png" alt="Members List" /></figure>
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-11-12 at 4.46.04 PM.png" alt="Member Actions" /></figure>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mute / Unmute Member">Temporarily restrict a user from sending messages; reversible at any time.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ban / Unban User">Block user and remove them from active participation. Unbanning restores eligibility to rejoin.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Change Role">Adjust permissions (e.g., moderator vs standard member) aligned with channel governance.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove User">Detach user from channel without punitive ban; they may rejoin if channel is public or invited.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ban vs Remove">
    - Ban: User flagged as blocked; cannot rejoin until unbanned.
    - Remove: Membership cleared; no block state.
    - Removing a banned user clears ban status—confirm enforcement intent before removing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="Banned Indicator" /></figure>

<Info>Use ban for policy violations; use remove for inactive or off-topic presence without formal enforcement.</Info>

## Chat Activities (Beta)

A user-centric analytics view (Manage Users → Chat Activities) showing per-user metrics:

- Total messages sent
- Channels joined
- Flagged messages involvement
- Channel-level breakdown of participation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Cases">Identify high-risk users (flag density), evaluate power contributors, support behavioral audits.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Moderation Workflow">Prioritize intervention for users generating disproportionate flagged content.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Engagement Strategy">Spot champions for recognition and retention programs.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Beta feature: Data refresh latency may apply; cross-verify before enforcement escalation.</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel Governance">
    - Define naming conventions for clarity.
    - Segment high-volume topics into dedicated channels.
    - Use Private Community channels for sensitive collaboration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notification Hygiene">
    - Default sparingly for high-noise channels.
    - Silent reduces fatigue during heavy announcement cycles.
    - Subscribe mode encourages opt-in relevance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moderation Discipline">
    - Ban only with documented rationale.
    - Review muted channels regularly; unmute when stability returns.
    - Reassess stopped channels quarterly (archive or permanently remove metadata).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Safety & Compliance">
    - Track flagged message ratio per channel.
    - Identify recurring violation patterns (spam clusters, harassment zones).
    - Escalate severe violations per internal protocol.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Cannot create channel | Missing permission / invalid ID | Verify role & unique ID format |
| Notification mode not saving | Unsaved dialog or permission | Reopen dialog, confirm role rights |
| User rejoined after remove | Remove used instead of ban | Apply ban for enforcement scenarios |
| Ban cleared unexpectedly | User removed while banned | Re-ban without removing membership first |
| Channel still visible to admins after delete | Expected soft delete behavior | No action; working as designed |
| Messages still incoming after mute | Delay / client cache | Confirm mute state; refresh clients |
| Flagged count not updating | Processing delay | Wait sync cycle or refresh panel |
