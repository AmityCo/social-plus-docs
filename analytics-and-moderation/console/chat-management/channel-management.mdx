# Channel Management

Admins have the capability to view all channels both open and closed. Additionally, creating a new channel is facilitated here.&#x20;

### Searching and Filtering

Admins can effortlessly search for and filter channels based on specific criteria. Both active and deleted channels are displayed in the list. To differentiate the state of the channel:

* Active channels are standard.
* Deleted channels feature a gray-tinted trash icon ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2566-10-02 at 15.44.50.png>).
* Muted channels are indicated by a mute icon ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2566-10-02 at 15.45.22.png>).
* Stopped channels display a gray-tinted stop icon ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2566-10-02 at 15.45.47.png>).

* Broadcast

To create a channel:

1. Navigate to the side menu and select **Channels**.
2. Under the **Channels** **Management** section, click on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-05-09 at 11.21.06.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> button and select the channel type.
3. A **Create New Channel** pop-up will appear. Fill in the required information:
   * **Channel ID**: Enter the ID for the channel.
   * **Display Name**: Provide a name that will be visible to all channel members.
   * **Mute Channel**: Check this option if you wish to mute all members within the channel.
   * **Channel privacy :** Decide to make this community Channel as Private or public. Only community channels can be rendered private.
   * **Push notifications Modes :** When a Channel is created or edited, it is now possible for Admins and Super Admins of console to define the Push notification mode
     * **Default mode :** In that case, all members will receive notifications. However, if they did not subscribe to notifications in this channel, they will not receive anything.
     * **Silent mode :** In that case, an admin is disabling all notifications for this channel even if members of this channel have subscribed to receiving notifications from this channel
     * **Subscribe mode :** Only members that subscribed to receiving notifications will receive any.&#x20;

## Managing Channel Users

To view the list of current members in the channel, select **Members**. Here, you will be able to manage users in the channel, such as:&#x20;

* Mute or unmute a channel member&#x20;
* Ban a user from the channel or unban them&#x20;
* Change a user's role within the channel&#x20;
* Remove a user from a channel&#x20;

You will also be able to see if a user has been banned from the channel, indicated by a banned symbol next to the user's name. To unban this user, simply click again on the banned button and confirm if you would like to unban them. Once a user has been unbanned from the channel, they will no longer appear as part of the channel member list and will be able to rejoin or be re-added to the channel.&#x20;

Do note that if you **remove** a banned channel member, their banned status will be cleared and they will be able to join or be added back into the channel as well.&#x20;
