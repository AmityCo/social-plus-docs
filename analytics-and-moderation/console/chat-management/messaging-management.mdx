# Message Management

## Broadcast Messages

The Broadcast channel is heavily adopted by corporate users who constantly promote or advertise their products, or make the announcement to drive awareness. Unlink other channel types, broadcast channels only allow admin users to send messages from the Console, and everyone else in the channel will be under read-only mode. Here are the steps to follow to send a broadcast message on Console.

<Info>
You can mention channel members in your broadcast messages by typing **@** to activate the mention suggestion and selecting their names in the suggestion list. Up to **30** channel members can be mentioned per message.

## Live Messages

Admins can join a channel and view messages being sent in real-time. They also will be able to filter messages by certain parameters, check current members in the channel and modify channel details such as tags and metadata.

Admins will also be able to broadcast messages directly in the channel.

### List of Message Types

The SDK supports the sending and receiving of 5 types of messages:

| Type   | Description                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text   | A message that contains only text                        |
| Image  | A message that contains an image                         |
| File   | A message that contains a file                           |
| Audio  | A message that contains an audio                         |
| Custom | A message that contains any data the user wants to store |

For more information on each of the message types, see [social.plus Message Types](https://docs.amity.co/amity-chat/core-concepts/messaging#message-types)&#x20;

### Pausing Data Stream

Because the messages are being sent in real-time, sometimes an Admin will have difficulty moderating when the messages are appearing quickly. In this scenario, Admins can pause the incoming data stream so that they can take action on a message. **This pause does not prevent users from sending messages in a channel** but simply stops the Admin Panel from receiving new messages. Once the live message has been unpaused, Admin will see all the messages again.

### Message Filters

Admins can filter what messages are to be shown on the live message stream. Currently, the SDK supports two types of filters:

1. Filter by Flagged\
   Show only messages that have been flagged by the admin or users.\

2. Filter by Threaded\
   Show only messages that are parent messages.

### View Mentioned Users

The mentioned feature in chat can be used to call attention to all or specific members in a channel. To view the members being mentioned in a message:

1. Go to  **Channels Management** and select a channel.
2. In the channel's page, the **Mentioned Users** column will list the members mentioned by a specific user in a message.&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="210">Mention</th><th width="232.33333333333331">Description</th><th>Mentioned users format</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mention</td><td>Description</td><td>Mentioned users format</td></tr><tr><td><code>@user</code></td><td>Mentions a specific channel member</td><td><code>userDisplayName(UserId)</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@all</code></td><td>Mentions all channel members</td><td><code>All channel members</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Mentioning `@all` members in the channel can be turned OFF:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Feature Settings**.
2. In **Feature Settings** page, uncheck **Allow to mention everyone in the channel** under Events. You can turn ON `@all` mention again.

<Info>
Turning OFF`@all` mentioning will only disable mentioning all members in the channel. However, you can still mention individual members because mentioning`@user` cannot be turned OFF.
