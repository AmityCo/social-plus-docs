## Broadcast Messages

Broadcast channels allow only admin / authorized staff to post while all other members are read‑only—ideal for high-signal announcements, policy updates, campaigns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Broadcast Channel">Create channel → select type Broadcast (see Channel Management for creation basics).</Step>
  <Step title="Open Channel">Select the broadcast channel from list.</Step>
  <Step title="Compose">Click Broadcast Message → choose message type → write content.</Step>
  <Step title="Mention (Optional)">@ to mention up to 30 members (strategic, not spammy).</Step>
  <Step title="Send">Click Broadcast and verify delivery.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Overusing broadcast channels for routine chatter reduces member trust. Reserve for material value updates.</Warning>

## Live Message Monitoring

Admins can enter any eligible channel to observe real‑time messages, apply filters, enforce policies, and send official interventions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Cases">Crisis escalation, abuse response, event moderation, launch day traffic, sentiment sampling.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capabilities">View live flow, pause stream locally, filter flagged / threaded parents, inspect mentions, action messages.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Note">Pausing stream does not halt user posting; backlog is applied once unpaused.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Pausing Data Stream

If messages scroll too quickly for review, pause to stabilize viewport:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Need">Identify rapid influx / potential violation cluster.</Step>
  <Step title="Activate Pause">Click Pause (stream stops updating locally).</Step>
  <Step title="Review & Action">Perform deletions, flag clearing, member actions.</Step>
  <Step title="Resume">Unpause to apply buffered messages.</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Pause is a local console viewing control—users continue real‑time conversation unaffected.</Info>

## Message Types

The system supports multiple structured types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Text | Plain textual content |
| Image | Message containing an image asset |
| File | Message containing a downloadable file |
| Audio | Message containing an audio clip |
| Custom | Developer-defined payload / structured custom data |

<Info>Custom messages should be clearly explainable in moderation notes to ensure consistent enforcement.</Info>

## Filtering

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Flagged">Displays only messages flagged by users/admins for priority moderation.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Threaded Parents">Shows only parent messages that have reply threads (contextual summarization).</Tab>
  <Tab title="Combined Workflow">Pause → Filter Flagged → Action → Resume for high-risk sweeps.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mentions Governance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="@user">Tag specific member for directed clarification or escalation. Use sparingly to avoid dogpiling.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@all">Notifies entire channel—restrict to high-importance updates. Can be disabled in Feature Settings.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Viewing Mentions">Open channel in management view → Mentioned Users column lists resolved user displayName(UserId) pairs.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disabling @all">Settings → Feature Settings → Uncheck "Allow to mention everyone in the channel". @user stays enabled.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-11-12 at 4.57.38 PM.png" alt="Mention Settings" /></figure>

<Info>Excessive @all usage increases notification fatigue; audit usage frequency monthly.</Info>

## Message Actions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Clear Flag">Removes all flags post-review to restore normal status signals.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Delete">Removes message content (shell may remain as sent by user with blank body). Use for policy violations.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Add to Blocklist">Extract problematic term(s) to preempt future violations.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Mute User">Temporarily prevent user from sending in channel; reversible.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Ban User">Force remove user + purge their messages from channel. Use for severe / repeated breaches.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Ban before removing if long-term exclusion is intended; removing first may clear enforcement state.</Warning>

## Enforcement Workflow Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect">Filter Flagged or observe pattern manually.</Step>
  <Step title="Stabilize">Pause stream (optional) for heavy influx.</Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate">Open context thread; inspect history & mentions.</Step>
  <Step title="Action">Delete / Ban / Blocklist / Mute as appropriate.</Step>
  <Step title="Document">Log rationale in internal system (if required).</Step>
  <Step title="Restore">Clear flags where resolved → Resume stream.</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Operational Discipline">
    - Use Pause only when necessary (avoid missing fast-moving signals).
    - Batch similar actions to reduce context switching.
    - Revisit blocklist quarterly for false positives.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality & Safety">
    - Delete only when content violates policy; otherwise educate via reply.
    - Prefer Mute for temporary disruption vs immediate ban.
    - Escalate self-harm / threat content per protocol before deletion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Broadcast Hygiene">
    - Consolidate multiple small announcements into a single structured broadcast.
    - Avoid marketing repetition; track engagement drop-off metrics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mentions Strategy">
    - Encourage targeted @user use for clarity.
    - Limit @all to critical updates (target threshold e.g., &lt;2 per week per channel).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Stream not resuming | Pause still active | Click Resume; verify UI state |
| Flag not clearing | Permission or stale state | Refresh; confirm role; retry |
| @all still works after disable | Cached settings | Refresh channel view; re-save setting |
| Blocklist term not applied | Formatting mismatch | Add normalized (lowercase / trimmed) variant |
| Broadcast failed | Network or missing rights | Retry; verify broadcast privilege |
| User keeps reoffending | Mute instead of ban | Apply ban + document rationale |
| Deleted message visible shell | Expected placeholder | No action—design for audit clarity |
