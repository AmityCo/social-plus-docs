# Chat Activities (Beta)

This feature presents a dedicated page, accessible via the **Manage Users** menu, then **Chat activities** tab . By selecting a specific user ID, admins can gain insights into the comprehensive chat activities of that user. This encompasses key metrics such as total messages sent, channels joined, and flagged messages. Further, a detailed table offers a deep dive into each user's chat interactions within specific channels, coupled with options to remove users or address flagged content. This user-centric design guarantees a streamlined experience for businesses.
