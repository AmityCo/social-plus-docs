## Roles and Permissions

Amity Console uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to provide granular control over admin privileges. You can create custom roles with specific permissions and assign them to admin users.

### System Roles

The platform includes a set of predefined system roles that can be assigned to admins. While these roles have a default set of permissions, you can also create your own custom roles.

| Role | Recommended Use Case |
|--- |--- |
| **Admin** | Has full access to all console features, including channels, communities, posts, moderation, ads, users, roles, and settings. |
| **Community Manager** | Can manage channels, posts, comments, livestreams, and users in assigned communities. Can’t access user management, admin, or settings. |
| **Moderator** | Can moderate posts, comments, and users in communities. Can’t create channels, manage categories, post as brand, or access admin or settings. |
| **Content Creator** | Can create posts, comments, stories, and communities. Can’t post as brand, manage users, create ads, or access admin tools or settings. |
| **Brand Partner** | Can create posts, comments, stories, livestreams, and communities. Can post as brand. No access to user management, ads, admin, roles, or settings. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to most areas, including channels, posts, comments, and communities. Can’t view admin users or settings. |

<Warning>
The **Admin** role grants extensive privileges. Assign it cautiously. For most team members, use more specific roles like **Community Manager** or **Moderator**.
</Warning>

### Permission Definitions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Manage Admins">
    **Allows:** Creating new admin users, editing their profiles, assigning roles, and managing community assignments.

    **Restriction:** All new admins are created with a "deny-by-default" stance, with no permissions enabled initially.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access Secure Mode">
    **Allows:** Generating and using elevated Admin Tokens for secure server-to-server API authentication.

    **Restriction:** Confine this permission to security and platform engineering teams. Separate it from daily operational roles to follow the principle of separation of duties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View-Only Access">
    **Allows:** Viewing console pages and data without the ability to perform actions.

    **Use Case:** Ideal for stakeholders who need visibility into analytics or moderation trends without having modification rights.

## Governance & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Always grant the minimum set of permissions required for an admin to perform their duties. Avoid using the Super Admin role for daily tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separation of Duties">
    Separate high-risk permissions from operational ones. For example, an admin with `Access Secure Mode` should not also have broad content moderation duties without a secondary approval process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quarterly Access Reviews">
    Regularly export the admin list and review each account's permissions and community assignments. Verify that the access level is still appropriate for their role and employment status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML) Process">
    Integrate admin account management with your HR processes. Ensure accounts are created upon hiring, modified upon role change, and revoked promptly upon departure (e.g., within 24 hours).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Cannot edit another admin | Your role lacks the "Manage Admins" permission. | Escalate to a Super Admin or an admin with the required permission to make the change. |
| Admin can see all communities | The admin's role has global access, or no communities were specified during assignment. | Edit the admin's profile and assign them to specific communities to restrict their view. |
| Unauthorized API token creation | The `Access Secure Mode` permission has been over-granted. | Revoke the permission from unauthorized users, rotate any exposed tokens, and audit API activity logs. |
