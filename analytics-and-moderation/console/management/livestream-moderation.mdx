## Admin Management

### Flagged Stream Review

When streams are flagged, administrators can:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Options" icon="search">
    - **View Flagged Content**: See specific frames that triggered the flag

  <Accordion title="Available Actions" icon="tools">
    - **Continue Stream**: Allow stream to proceed normally
    - **Stop Stream**: Immediately terminate the live broadcast
    - **Delete Stream**: Remove stream and associated content
    - **Issue Warning**: Send notification to streamer
    - **Temporary Ban**: Restrict user's streaming privileges
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Configuration Interface

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2567-11-12 at 5.33.35 PM.png" alt="Livestream Moderation Settings" />

Configure moderation settings through the social.plus Console:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Settings">
    Navigate to **Moderation > Livestream Settings** in your console.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Confidence Levels">
    Adjust flag and termination thresholds for each content category.
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Threshold Tuning" icon="sliders">
    **Start Conservative**
    - Begin with default settings (Flag: 40%, Terminate: 75%)
    - Monitor false positive and false negative rates
    - Adjust gradually based on community standards
    
    **Category-Specific Tuning**
    - Set stricter thresholds for explicit content
    - Allow more tolerance for edge cases like art or education
    - Consider cultural context and community norms
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Response Strategy" icon="strategy">
    **Balanced Approach**
    - Use flagging for borderline content requiring human judgment
    - Reserve automatic termination for clear violations
    - Implement graduated penalties for repeat offenders
    
    **User Communication**
    - Provide clear guidelines about acceptable streaming content
    - Send educational notifications rather than just penalties
    - Maintain appeal processes for disputed decisions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitoring & Optimization" icon="chart-line">
    **Regular Review**
    - Weekly analysis of flagged vs. terminated streams
    - Monthly review of threshold effectiveness
    - Quarterly policy updates based on community feedback
    
    **Performance Metrics**
    - Track moderation accuracy rates
    - Monitor streamer satisfaction and retention
    - Measure community safety improvements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Considerations

<Warning>
**Confidence Level Impact**: Setting confidence levels too low (near 0%) will result in excessive false positives, potentially disrupting legitimate streams and frustrating users.
</Warning>

### Performance Impact

- **Latency**: Minimal impact on stream quality (< 200ms processing delay)
- **Bandwidth**: No additional bandwidth required from streamers
- **Scalability**: Handles concurrent streams automatically
- **Reliability**: Redundant processing ensures consistent moderation

### Privacy & Compliance

- **Data Processing**: Content analyzed in real-time, not stored permanently
- **Regional Compliance**: Meets GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **Transparency**: Clear policies about automated moderation usage
- **User Rights**: Appeal processes and human review availability

## Troubleshooting

    **High False Positive Rate**
    - Increase confidence thresholds gradually
    - Review specific content categories causing issues
    - Consider community-specific content norms
    
    **Missed Violations**
    - Decrease confidence thresholds carefully
    - Enable additional detection categories
