## Overview

Live Stream Management with multi-stream support allows you to deliver professional, device-optimized viewing experiences. By associating multiple camera feeds with a single live stream post, you can provide:

- **Vertical streams (9:16)** optimized for mobile devices
- **Horizontal streams (16:9)** optimized for desktop and tablets
- **Custom aspect ratios** for specialized viewing scenarios

This eliminates the "one-size-fits-all" compromise and ensures your live events look polished on every screen.

<Warning>
**UIKit Compatibility**: Multi-stream (child streams) functionality is not supported in UIKit. UIKit will only work with the parent stream. For multi-stream implementation, use the SDK or API directly.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Stream Metadata**: You can use live stream metadata to distinguish between parent and child streams and define their specific use cases (e.g., "mobile-view", "desktop-view"). This metadata can be integrated using either the API or SDK to enable custom stream selection logic in your application.
</Info>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Parent Stream">
    Set up the main live stream with title, description, and thumbnail.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Child Streams (Optional)">
    Add up to 2 additional feeds for device-specific views.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Post">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Broadcast">
    Track status, duration, and moderation across all feeds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Parent Streams

A parent stream is the primary live stream that serves as the default feed. It contains the essential information for your live event.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Required Information" icon="star">
    - **Title**: Clear, descriptive name for the live stream event (required)
    - **Description**: Additional context about the event (optional)
    - **Thumbnail**: Preview image for the stream (recommended)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stream Options" icon="gear">
    - **Secure Streaming**: Enable to restrict stream access with authentication
    - **Camera Feed Name**: Defaults to "Main Feed" (customizable, 30 character limit)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stream ID & Configuration" icon="key">
    - Upon creation, a unique stream ID is automatically generated
    - This ID is used to link child streams and create posts
    - Stream configuration cannot be changed after going live
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to live streams">
    Go to Console → Management → live streams.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Stream">
    Click "Create live stream" button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Fill in title, description, and upload thumbnail image.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Enable secure streaming if needed and customize feed name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Creation">
    Review details and click "Create" to generate the parent stream.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Child Streams

Child streams enable multi-stream functionality by providing device-specific video feeds under a parent stream. Add up to 2 child streams for a total of 3 simultaneous feeds.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Adding a Child Stream

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Parent Stream">
    Open the parent stream details from the live stream list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Child Stream">
    Click "Add Child Stream" (available if fewer than 2 child streams exist).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inherited Information">
    Child streams automatically inherit title and description from parent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Feed Name">
    Set a custom name (default: "Additional feed 1/2", 30 character limit).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Stream">
    Complete setup and receive a unique stream ID for the child feed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Child Stream Characteristics">
    - Inherits title and description from parent stream
    - Can have custom camera feed name (e.g., "Mobile View", "Desktop View")
    - Receives unique stream ID for independent broadcasting
    - Shares moderation and post association with parent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Naming Best Practices">
    - Use descriptive names: "Mobile View", "Desktop View", "Camera 2"
    - Keep names concise (30 character limit)
    - Maintain consistent naming conventions across events
    - Consider audience perspective in naming
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Limitation**: You can add a maximum of 2 child streams per parent stream (3 total feeds). Plan your multi-stream strategy accordingly.
</Warning>

## Editing Stream Details

Update stream information to keep event details accurate. Changes are allowed before and during broadcasts, with some restrictions.

### Editable Fields

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Parent Stream">
    - **Title**: Main event title
    - **Description**: Event description and context
    - **Thumbnail**: Preview image
    - **Camera Feed Name**: Default "Main Feed" (customizable)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Child Stream">
    - **Title**: Inherited from parent (editable)
    - **Description**: Inherited from parent (editable)
    - **Camera Feed Name**: Default "Additional feed x" (customizable)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Copy live stream Link

Share your live stream with audiences using the copy link feature:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Broadcast Not Started" icon="clock">
    **No copy link button available**

    Link generation begins when broadcast starts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Broadcast Ongoing" icon="signal">
    **"Copy live stream link"**

    Share real-time access to the active live stream.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Broadcast Ended" icon="check">
    **"Copy live stream post link"**

    Share link to the recorded content and engagement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deleting Child Streams

Remove child streams that are no longer needed or were created in error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Stream">
    Open parent stream and locate the child stream to delete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Deletion">
    Click delete icon next to the child stream.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Review confirmation modal with status warning if stream is live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Removal">
    Confirm to permanently delete the child stream.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Live Stream Warning**: If the child stream is currently broadcasting, the confirmation modal will warn that deletion will immediately disconnect the stream. Active viewers will lose access.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Parent Stream Protection**: Parent streams cannot be deleted if they have associated posts or child streams. Remove child streams and unlink posts first.
</Note>

## Live Stream Management List

The live stream management page displays all streams with unified status reflecting both parent and child stream states.

### List View Columns

| Column | Description | Logic |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Title** | Parent stream title | Always displays parent stream title |
| **Creator** | Stream creator | Parent stream creator information |
| **Broadcast Status** | Current stream state | Unified status across all feeds (see below) |
| **Duration** | Stream length | Longest completed stream duration |
| **Moderation Status** | Content review state | Up to 5 unique status codes (see below) |
| **Created At** | Stream creation time | Parent stream creation timestamp |

### Broadcast Status Logic

The broadcast status reflects the unified state of parent and child streams:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not Started" icon="clock">
    **Displayed when**: None of the parent or child streams have started broadcasting.

    This is the initial state after stream creation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Live" icon="signal">
    **Displayed when**: At least one stream (parent or child) is currently broadcasting.

    Priority status - displayed even if other streams are finished or not started.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finished" icon="check">
    **Displayed when**:
    - All streams have finished broadcasting, OR
    - At least one stream finished and others have not started

    Indicates the live event has concluded.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Duration Display

The duration field shows the **longest completed stream** among parent and child feeds:

- Calculates from stream start to end time
- Displays only when at least one stream has finished
- Uses longest duration if multiple streams have different lengths
- Remains empty if no streams have completed

### Moderation Status Logic

Moderation status provides a consolidated view of content review across all streams:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Display Rules">
    - Shows **up to 5 unique status codes** across parent and child streams
    - **Hides duplicate** status codes from different streams
    - Displays codes sorted by severity: Red > Yellow > Green
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Status Types">
    **Green "Passed"**: All streams finished and passed moderation

    **Grey "Moderating"**: At least one stream is live with no critical flags

    **Red/Yellow Codes**: Specific moderation flags requiring review
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Overflow Handling">
    If more than 5 unique status codes exist:
    - Display only **highest severity level** codes
    - Priority order: Red (critical) > Yellow (warning) > Green (passed)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Moderation Priority**: Focus on Red status codes first, as they indicate critical content that may violate community guidelines or require immediate action.
</Info>

## Post Integration

Create live stream posts that link to parent streams and automatically include all associated child streams.

<Info>
For detailed information about creating and managing posts, see [Posts Management](/analytics-and-moderation/console/social-management/social-management/posts).
</Info>

<Note>
**Client-Side Intelligence**: When users view a live stream post, client applications (iOS, Android, Web) using SDK or API can automatically select the optimal stream (parent or child) based on device type and screen orientation for the best viewing experience. UIKit applications will display the parent stream only.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Metadata Integration**: Use stream metadata to identify stream purposes and implement custom stream selection logic. For example, add metadata like `{"deviceType": "mobile", "orientation": "vertical"}` to help your application choose the appropriate stream for each user's context.
</Tip>

### API-Created Streams

<Info>
**API Integration**: Streams created via API without a specified camera feed name will display default names in the Console. You can edit these names at any time through the Console interface.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Stream Strategy" icon="chess">
    - **Plan ahead**: Determine which devices need optimized feeds before going live
    - **Test thoroughly**: Verify all streams are properly configured before broadcast
    - **Name clearly**: Use descriptive camera feed names for easy identification
    - **Monitor unified**: Watch all feeds' status during live events
    - **Use metadata**: Add meaningful metadata to identify stream purposes and enable smart selection
    - **SDK/API only**: Remember that multi-stream requires SDK or API integration, not UIKit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Production Quality" icon="star">
    - **Thumbnail selection**: Choose engaging, high-quality preview images
    - **Title optimization**: Write clear, compelling event titles
    - **Description detail**: Provide context and expectations for viewers
    - **Secure streaming**: Enable for private or restricted-access events
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance & Reliability" icon="gauge">
    - **Bandwidth planning**: Ensure sufficient upload capacity for multiple streams
    - **Redundancy**: Have backup feeds ready for critical events
    - **Status monitoring**: Keep Console open during broadcasts to track status
    - **Child stream limits**: Respect the 2 child stream maximum
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audience Engagement" icon="users">
    - **Timing optimization**: Schedule streams during peak audience availability
    - **Post integration**: Create posts before going live to build anticipation
    - **Link sharing**: Use copy link feature to promote across channels
    - **Post-event access**: Keep streams available for replay engagement
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Cannot add child stream | Already have 2 child streams | Maximum limit reached - delete existing child stream first |
| Stream not showing as Live | Status update delay or network issue | Refresh page; verify stream is actually broadcasting |
| Cannot delete parent stream | Has associated posts or child streams | Remove child streams and unlink posts before deletion |
| Copy link not available | Stream has not started | Link generation begins when broadcast starts |
| Child stream creation fails | Network error or permission issue | Verify permissions and retry; check connection |
| Duration not displaying | No streams have completed | Duration appears only after at least one stream finishes |
| Moderation status unclear | Multiple flags across streams | Review each stream individually for detailed status |
| Unsaved changes lost | Exited without confirming | Always confirm save or discard in modal prompt |
| Stream disconnects on deletion | Deleted live child stream | Deletion confirmation warned of active stream - plan deletions |
| Feed name too long | Exceeds 30 character limit | Shorten name to meet character limit |
| Child streams not showing in UIKit | UIKit doesn't support multi-stream | Use SDK or API for multi-stream functionality; UIKit shows parent only |
| Cannot identify stream purpose | Missing metadata | Add metadata when creating streams via API/SDK for identification |
