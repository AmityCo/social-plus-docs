## Overview

Events Management in the social.plus Console provides a centralized dashboard for creating, organizing, and monitoring events across your communities. Whether your audience engages through live streams, joins via external platforms, or attends in person, the Console gives you full control over the event lifecycle.

The events list displays all events with the following information at a glance:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Event title** | The name of the event |
| **Type** | Event type — `Livestream`, `In-person`, or `Virtual` (external link) |
| **Created in** | The community or feed where the event was created |
| **Creator** | The user who created the event |
| **Starts / Ends** | Scheduled start and end date/time |
| **Status** | Current status — `Upcoming`, `Ongoing`, or `Ended` |
| **Attendees** | Number of users who joined or RSVP'd |
| **Created at** | Timestamp of event creation |

You can filter events by **creator** and **status** using the dropdown filters at the top of the page.

## Event Status Lifecycle

Events automatically transition through statuses based on the current time relative to the scheduled dates:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Upcoming] -->|Start time reached| B[Ongoing]
    B -->|End time reached| C[Ended]
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Upcoming** | The event has been created but the start time has not yet been reached |
| **Ongoing** | The event is currently active (between start and end times) |
| **Ended** | The event has passed its scheduled end time |

## Filtering and Search

Use the filters at the top of the events dashboard to narrow down the event list:

- **Select creator** — Filter events by the user who created them
- **Filter by status** — Show only events with a specific status (`Upcoming`, `Ongoing`, or `Ended`)

The pagination controls at the bottom of the table allow you to navigate through large event lists, with configurable page sizes (default: 10 per page).

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event Planning" icon="clipboard-list">
    - **Use descriptive titles** — Make event names clear and informative so users can quickly understand the event purpose
    - **Set accurate timezones** — Always verify the timezone matches the intended audience or event location
    - **Add thumbnails** — Events with images attract more attention; use 16:9 ratio for best display
    - **Write detailed descriptions** — Include what attendees can expect, any prerequisites, and relevant links
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Community Engagement" icon="comments">
    - **Create events in relevant communities** — Target the right audience by selecting the appropriate community
    - **Schedule in advance** — Give users enough lead time to plan for attendance
    - **Monitor activities** — Regularly check the Activities tab for engagement and respond to posts
    - **Track attendees** — Use the Attendees tab to understand participation rates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Type Selection" icon="route">
    - **Livestream** — Best for interactive sessions where you want attendees to stay within your platform
    - **External link** — Use when leveraging established conferencing tools (Zoom, Meet, Teams)
    - **In-person** — Provide complete address details so attendees can easily find the venue
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
