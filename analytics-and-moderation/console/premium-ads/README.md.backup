# Premium Ads

**Premium Ads** is a feature designed to enhance your social network by allowing personalized ad placements. Whether you're promoting personal products or monetizing your platform, Premium Ads offers versatile tools for various advertising needs. It seamlessly integrates third-party advertisers, establishes profitable partnerships, and displays ads across your network.

Our Premium Ads feature offers:

* **Awareness**: Designed to increase brand awareness without expecting immediate user interaction, perfect for broad-reach campaigns.
* **Consideration**: Aimed at driving traffic, app installs, video views, or lead generation by targeting specific user segments.
* **Conversion**: Optimized for maximizing sales conversions, prompting users to take immediate action such as purchasing or signing up for a service.

## **Ads Display Settings**&#x20;

You can customize how and when ads appear with two available modes:

1. **Fixed Frequency**: Ads appear at regular intervals based on your settings. This option ensures a predictable ad pattern. For Example: “Every 5 posts, 1 ad will appear.”

If there are fewer posts, comments, or stories than the set frequency, one ad will still be displayed. However, ads will not be displayed if there are no posts, comments, or stories.&#x20;

<Info>
This setting may result in seeing duplicate ads. You can adjust the frequency of how often users see the same ad within a certain period to avoid overexposure and ensure a balanced experience.&#x20;
</Info>

2. **Time window**: Ads appear only once within the specified period you choose. This option prevents repeated ad exposure in a short time frame. For Example: "In every 10 minutes, 1 ad will appear."

## **Scoring**

The scoring system in Premium Ads determines the order in which ads are displayed. Here's how it works:

* Each ad post has a count associated with it, determining its priority in display order.
  * The first ad post receives more points.
  * Subsequent posts get progressively fewer points.
* This scoring system ensures ads with higher points (shown more frequently) are less likely to repeat.
* Ads with lower points (shown less regularly) are given increased visibility.

<Info>
This system helps distribute ad impressions more evenly and prevents users from repeatedly seeing the same ad.

## Premium Ads Placement

There are three available options where ads can be displayed within the app:

* **Post Ads**: appear within the community feed alongside user posts, ensuring seamless integration posts.&#x20;
* **Story Ads**: appear within the Stories through short-lived photos or videos, providing real-time and engaging content.
* **Comment Ads**: appear within comment sections of posts, targeting active discussions.

Chat list header and Group chat header Ads Placement is not yet implemented.
