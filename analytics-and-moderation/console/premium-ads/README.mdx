## Access & Navigation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login">Open Social Plus Console & authenticate.</Step>
  <Step title="Open Ads Module">Sidebar → Ads → Premium Ads.</Step>
  <Step title="Select Campaign Type">Awareness / Consideration / Conversion.</Step>
  <Step title="Configure Display">Choose placement + frequency mode.</Step>
  <Step title="Launch & Monitor">Publish and track delivery / pacing.</Step>
</Steps>

## Display Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fixed Frequency">
    Predictable cadence (e.g., 1 ad every 5 posts). Guarantees minimum visibility even in low-content contexts (at least one ad if some content exists). Avoids empty inventory when content volume is low.
    
    <Info>Duplicate exposure may occur at very high frequency settings. Adjust frequency caps to mitigate fatigue.</Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Time Window">
    Enforces temporal pacing (e.g., max 1 ad / 10 minutes). Prevents clustering during rapid scrolling sessions and smooths experience for highly active users.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Choosing Mode">
    - Use Fixed Frequency for stable engagement feeds.<br/>
    - Use Time Window for bursty activity (live events, spikes).<br/>
    - Hybrid strategy: Start with Frequency, switch to Window during campaigns.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Scoring System

The scoring engine prioritizes ad rotation fairness:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Point Allocation">Earlier (higher priority) ad items receive more points; lower-ranked ads accrue fewer points but are boosted later to maintain distribution.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repetition Control">Higher cumulative exposure reduces near-term selection probability, lowering duplication risk.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fairness Objective">Ensures inventory breadth—maximizes distinct impressions before repeating the same creative.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimization Lever">Adjust scoring weights if certain campaigns require guaranteed prominence (e.g., compliance banners).</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>Review repetition rate weekly. If same-ad repeat rate > threshold (e.g., 20% of impressions within session), increase score decay or widen pool.</Info>

## Placements

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Post Ads">Inserted within community feed between organic posts. Best for standard awareness & conversion funnels.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Story Ads">Displayed between user stories; leverage motion & time-limited exposure for consideration or launches.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Comment Ads">Appear inside active discussion threads—high intent context; use sparingly to avoid disruption.</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Chat list header & group chat header placements are not yet implemented.</Warning>

## Configuration Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Placement">Choose Post / Story / Comment during setup.</Step>
  <Step title="Set Objective">Map to Awareness, Consideration, or Conversion to inform targeting & creative guidelines.</Step>
  <Step title="Define Display Mode">Pick Fixed Frequency or Time Window pacing.</Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Frequency Caps">Set per-session or per-user repetition constraints.</Step>
  <Step title="Apply Scoring Tweaks">Optionally boost priority campaigns.</Step>
  <Step title="Save & Activate">Confirm settings → launch.</Step>
</Steps>

## Governance & Policy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Brand Safety">Screen creatives for policy compliance before activation; archive disallowed variants.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Experience">Cap intrusive formats; avoid back-to-back ad slots unless high-value campaign.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Frequency Caps">Implement daily & session-level impression caps per unique creative.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audit Logs">Maintain change log (who adjusted frequency / scoring) for accountability.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalation">Flag suspicious CTR anomalies (potential fraud) for manual review.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Interpretation | Optimization Action |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Impression Share | Share of eligible slots filled | Increase inventory pool / pacing adjustment |
| Unique Reach | Distinct users served | Broaden targeting or diversify creatives |
| Avg Frequency | Repetition per user | Tighten caps if saturation risk |
| CTR | Creative relevance | A/B test messaging / placement | 
| Conversion Rate | Funnel effectiveness | Refine post-click flow / adjust objective |
| Duplicate Ratio | Same creative repeated | Tweak scoring / expand creative set |

<Info>Track Awareness on reach & frequency, Consideration on CTR & engagement dwell, Conversion on post-click / attributed actions.</Info>

## Optimization Playbooks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Low CTR">Rotate underperforming creatives → test new formats → adjust placement mix.</Tab>
  <Tab title="High Duplicate Rate">Lower fixed frequency or switch to Time Window + boost creative pool.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Under-Delivery">Relax pacing, widen targeting, verify placements enabled.</Tab>
  <Tab title="UX Complaints">Reduce ads per interval, enforce stricter frequency caps.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Conversion Plateau">Shift objective weighting, refine landing experience, test ad sequencing.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Strategic Alignment">Match objective to creative format—rich media for consideration; concise value props for conversion.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creative Rotation">Refresh at defined cadence (e.g., every 2 weeks) to combat fatigue.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Session Experience">Avoid first-slot ad on initial page load when possible.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Hygiene">Remove expired or paused campaigns to keep scoring accurate.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Story Placement">Use vertical-friendly aspect ratios & early brand reveal.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Ads not showing | No eligible inventory or misconfigured placement | Verify placement enabled & content volume present |
| High repetition | Too narrow creative pool / high fixed frequency | Add creatives or switch to Time Window |
| Low impressions | Overly strict pacing or targeting | Loosen caps / expand audience |
| CTR drop | Creative fatigue | Rotate assets / test variants |
| Time window ignored | Overlapping conflicting config | Re-save settings; ensure only one active pacing rule |
| Duplicate appearing back-to-back | Scoring weights misbalanced | Increase decay or minimum separation rule |
