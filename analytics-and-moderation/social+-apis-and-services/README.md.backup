# Social Plus APIs and Services

## Using API

Social Plus APIs can be used either in **Admin** or **User** context. Regardless of whether you are using it as an admin or a user, you will need an access token before you can use the API.&#x20;

### Admin&#x20;

For Administrators who are using our APIs in making server-to-server API calls, you need an **Admin Access token** to connect to the Amity server.&#x20;

Refer to [Admin API Access Token](https://docs.amity.co/console/settings#admin-api-access-token) for the instructions on how to generate the admin access token.

### User

If you want to use the Social Plus APIs as a user, you need to register a session via [Session API](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Session/post\_api\_v3\_sessions) to retrieve the **User Access token**. Once you've received the `accessToken`, you can use the token to call other API endpoints. Please note that the User Access token is subject to the same authorization as the owner of the access token.

<Info>
User Access token is valid for 30 days. However, it will be invalidated if a different user ID of the same device is registered with [Device API](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Device/post\_v1\_device).
</Info>

#### Revoke the User Access Token

User's access tokens can be revoked via the [Revoke API](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Session/delete\_api\_v4\_sessions). This API can only be used with an admin access token.

## API Reference

Once you have the appropriate access token, you can now use the token to make API calls.&#x20;

Our API documentation explains all API endpoints used in Social Plus. Refer to[ Social Plus API documentation](https://api-docs.amity.co/) for a list of all our Social Plus Rest APIs.â€‹
