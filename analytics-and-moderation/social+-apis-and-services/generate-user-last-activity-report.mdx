title: "User Last Activity Report"
description: "Export per-user last read & write timestamps to identify inactive accounts and drive re‑engagement or cleanup actions"
---
## Overview

The User Last Activity Report provides the most recent timestamps of key actions (read + write) per user. Administrators use it to:

- Identify inactive / dormant accounts
- Drive re‑engagement campaigns (email / push)
- Plan archival or deletion workflows (e.g., GDPR cleanup)
- Validate growth & retention metrics against real interaction

<Info>
	Requires an **admin session**. These endpoints are for server / internal tooling only—never expose admin credentials to clients.
</Info>

## When To Use

Use this report when you need a lightweight snapshot of user activity recency rather than full behavioral analytics. For richer metrics (MAU/DAU, content engagement) see the broader **Analytics APIs** in the <a href="/analytics-and-moderation/social+-apis-and-services/README">API Overview</a>.


## Access & Permissions

- Admin credentials (session cookie) required
- Scoped to your network / application only
- Rate limits apply (avoid high-frequency polling—prefer scheduled exports)

<Warning>
	Do not embed admin cookie logic in front-end code. Generate and process reports using a secure backend or internal admin tool.
</Warning>

## Export Flow

<Steps>
	<Step title="Authenticate Admin Session">
		Submit credentials to obtain an authenticated admin session (cookie-based). Store cookie securely in memory only.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Request Report Export">
		Call the report endpoint. Large datasets may stream or paginate depending on infrastructure.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Download / Stream Data">
		Parse JSON or save CSV output (depending on Accept header or tool). Validate column presence.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Process & Act">
		Join with internal user tables. Segment inactive cohorts. Trigger re‑engagement or cleanup workflows.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## API Contract (High-Level)

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Method | GET |
| Path | `/admin/v1/reports/user-last-activity` |
| Auth | Admin session cookie |
| Format | JSON (default) or CSV (if `Accept: text/csv`) |
| Pagination | Implementation-specific (check `nextCursor` if present) |

<Tip>
	Prefer cursor-based pagination (if available) for large networks instead of increasing page size.
</Tip>

### Request

```
GET https://{region-host}/admin/v1/reports/user-last-activity
Cookie: <admin-session-cookie>
Accept: application/json
```



## Interpreting Results

| Scenario | Interpretation | Suggested Action |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| All fields null | Newly created / never logged in | Onboarding reminder |
| Read present, write null | Lurker / consumer only | Engagement nudge (posting tips) |
| Write recent, login stale | Background activity? Validate session tracking | Verify auth flows |
| No activity ≥ 90 days | Dormant account | Re‑engagement or archival workflow |

## Automation Ideas

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Re‑Engagement Campaigns">
		Export weekly, filter users with `lastActivityAt` older than threshold, send personalized email or push, measure reactivation rate.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Dormant Cleanup">
		Flag accounts inactive > 180 days for soft archival. After notice period, proceed with deletion respecting compliance rules.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Security Monitoring">
		Detect sudden stop in activity of high‑value users—trigger internal review or outreach.
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| 401 / Unauthorized | Missing / expired admin cookie | Re-authenticate and resend request |
| Empty dataset | Filters defaulting to restrictive scope (if any) | Remove params / verify user activity exists |
| Missing columns | Feature disabled / retention policy | Confirm configuration; adapt parsing |
| Slow export | Large dataset without pagination | Use pagination or request CSV streaming |

<Tip>
	Always log the raw HTTP status + response headers for diagnostics. Store processed data separately from raw export for reproducibility.
