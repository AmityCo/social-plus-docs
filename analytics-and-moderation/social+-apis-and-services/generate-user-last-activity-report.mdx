title: "User Last Activity Report"
description: "Export per-user last read & write timestamps to identify inactive accounts and drive re‑engagement or cleanup actions"
---
## Overview

The User Last Activity Report provides the most recent timestamps of key actions (read + write) per user. Administrators use it to:

- Identify inactive / dormant accounts
- Drive re‑engagement campaigns (email / push)
- Plan archival or deletion workflows (e.g., GDPR cleanup)
- Validate growth & retention metrics against real interaction

<Info>
	Requires an **admin session**. These endpoints are for server / internal tooling only—never expose admin credentials to clients.
</Info>

## When To Use

Use this report when you need a lightweight snapshot of user activity recency rather than full behavioral analytics. For richer metrics (MAU/DAU, content engagement) see the broader **Analytics APIs** in the <a href="/analytics-and-moderation/social+-apis-and-services/README">API Overview</a>.


## Access & Permissions

- Admin credentials (admin token) required in Authorization header
- Scoped to your network / application only
- Rate limits apply (avoid high-frequency polling—prefer scheduled exports)
- **Minimum 5,000 users required** in your application to generate the report

<Warning>
	Do not embed admin token logic in front-end code. Generate and process reports using a secure backend or internal admin tool.
</Warning>

<Info>
	**User Count Requirement**: Your application must have at least 5,000 users to generate the User Last Activity Report. If your application has fewer users, the report generation will not be available.
</Info>

## Export Flow

<Steps>
	<Step title="Authenticate Admin Session">
		Submit credentials to obtain an authenticated admin session (token-based).
	</Step>
	<Step title="Request Report Export">
		Call the report endpoint. Response will return in CSV format.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Process & Act">
		Using the CSV output to trigger re‑engagement or cleanup workflows (bulk user delete API).
	</Step>
</Steps>

## API Contract (High-Level)

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Method | GET |
| Path | `/api/v1/reports/user-last-activity` |
| Auth | Admin token |
| Format | CSV |

<Tip>
	Prefer cursor-based pagination (if available) for large networks instead of increasing page size.
</Tip>

	See complete request/response schemas, parameters, and examples. This API only accepts admin token as authorization.
</Card>

## Interpreting Results

The report returns a CSV with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `user_id` | Internal user identifier |
| `user_public_id` | Public-facing user ID |
| `display_name` | User's display name |
| `last_active_utc` | Most recent activity timestamp (UTC) |

### Activity Patterns

| Scenario | Interpretation | Suggested Action |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| `last_active_utc` is null | Newly created / never logged in | Onboarding reminder |
| `last_active_utc` < 30 days ago | Active user | Continue regular engagement |
| `last_active_utc` 30-90 days ago | At-risk user | Re-engagement campaign |
| `last_active_utc` ≥ 90 days ago | Dormant account | Re‑engagement or archival workflow |

## Automation Ideas

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Re‑Engagement Campaigns">
		Export weekly, filter users with `last_active_utc` older than threshold, send personalized email or push, measure reactivation rate.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Dormant Cleanup">
		Flag accounts inactive > 180 days for soft archival. After notice period, proceed with deletion respecting compliance rules.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Bulk Delete Inactive Users">
		Use the CSV output directly with the [Bulk User Delete API](/api-reference/user/create-bulk-user-delete-job) to clean up inactive accounts. The API accepts the CSV format from this report, making it seamless to process dormant users at scale while maintaining audit trails.
	</Accordion>
	<Accordion title="Security Monitoring">
		Detect sudden stop in activity of high‑value users—trigger internal review or outreach.
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| 401 / Unauthorized | Missing / expired admin cookie | Re-authenticate and resend request |
| Report not available | Application has fewer than 5,000 users | Wait until your application reaches 5,000 users minimum |
| Empty dataset | Filters defaulting to restrictive scope (if any) | Remove params / verify user activity exists |
| Missing columns | Feature disabled / retention policy | Confirm configuration; adapt parsing |
| Slow export | Large dataset without pagination | Use pagination or request CSV streaming |

<Tip>
	Always log the raw HTTP status + response headers for diagnostics. Store processed data separately from raw export for reproducibility.
</Tip>
