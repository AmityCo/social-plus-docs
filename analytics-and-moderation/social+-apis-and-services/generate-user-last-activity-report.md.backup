# Generate User Last Activity Report

User last activity report helps network administrators view a user's activity by date and timestamp based on read and write actions of the users. This allows the administrator to identify active and inactive users.

Using this report, the administrator can also decide what action to take for these inactive users, such as hard deleting them or sending them a notification.

You need an admin account to generate the user's last activity report.

<Info>
When you set up the app for the first time in our portal, you will receive an administrator account. Alternatively, you can create an administrator account through the SP Console.
