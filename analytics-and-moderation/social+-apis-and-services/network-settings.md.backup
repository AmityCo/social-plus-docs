# Network Settings

To tweak the user experience for everyone on your network, you will need to use the Network Settings apis with an **Admin Token**. These services will enable you to toggle application controls such as:

* the ability to mention users
* showing all posts instead of only followed posts on the global feed
* user privacy modes

To see the full list of supported controls, consult the [Network Settings ](https://api-docs.amity.co/#/Network%20Setting)section.
