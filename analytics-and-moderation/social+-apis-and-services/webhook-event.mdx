<Warning>
**Infrastructure Update - Action Required by June 9, 2025**

We are updating the list of IP addresses used by our webhook service as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance infrastructure security and reliability.

**What's Changing:**
- A new set of IP addresses will be introduced for webhook traffic
- Current IP addresses will be deprecated and stop working after June 9, 2025

**Action Required:**
Update your firewall or allowlist configurations to include the new IP addresses before June 9, 2025 to ensure uninterrupted webhook delivery.
</Warning>

## Overview

Webhook Events provide a powerful way to extend social.plus functionality by receiving real-time triggers from the platform. When enabled, events from your Chat and Social SDK are forwarded to your system instantly, enabling custom integrations and automation.

## How Webhooks Work

<Info>
**Webhook vs Traditional API**: Unlike traditional APIs where your application makes requests to receive responses, webhooks are "reverse APIs" where social.plus initiates communication by sending data to your system as soon as events occur.
</Info>

### Event-Driven Architecture

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event Triggers">
    **Real-Time Delivery**
    - Events are triggered instantly when actions occur in your social.plus application
    - HTTP POST payloads sent to your configured webhook URLs
    - Near-real-time delivery for immediate response capabilities

    **Event Types**
    - User actions (posts, comments, reactions)
    - Chat messages and channel events
    - Community and social interactions
    - Moderation and safety events
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Characteristics">
    **Performance Considerations**
    - All webhook requests timeout in 1.5 seconds
    - Your webhook endpoint must respond within this interval
    - System should return HTTP 200 status with empty JSON response

    **Reliability Features**
    - Automatic retry mechanisms for failed deliveries
    - Signature verification for security
    - Scalable infrastructure for high-volume events
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setup and Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Webhook Feature">
    Submit a request through our [support team](mailto:support@social.plus) to enable webhooks (currently in Private Beta). Processing takes approximately 5 business days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook URLs">
    Admin users can create and manage webhooks in the admin panel:
    - Add webhook URLs for event delivery
    - Configure event types and filters
    - Set up authentication and security
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Webhook Receiver">
    Build your webhook endpoint to:
    - Accept HTTP POST requests
    - Verify webhook signatures
    - Process events and respond within 1.5 seconds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Monitor">
    Test your webhook implementation and monitor delivery success rates and response times
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration Limits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Webhook Limit" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Maximum 10 webhooks per network**
    
    Recommended to keep webhook count reasonable for optimal performance and management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Response Time" icon="clock">
    **1.5 second timeout**
    
    Ensure your webhook endpoint responds quickly to prevent request timeouts and delivery failures
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security and Authentication

### Signature Verification

<Warning>
**Security Requirement**: Always verify the `x-amity-signature` header before processing webhook events to prevent request forgery and ensure data integrity.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Header Details">
    ### Delivery Headers
    
    All webhook HTTP POST requests include these headers:

    | Header | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `x-amity-signature` | HMAC Base64 digest of the response body using SHA-256 hash function |
    | `User-Agent` | Identifies the webhook delivery system |
    | `Content-Type` | Always `application/json` |
    | `Content-Length` | Size of the JSON payload |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Legacy Support">
    ### Backward Compatibility
    
    <Info>
    **Legacy Header**: You may receive duplicate requests with `x-eko-signature` header for backward compatibility. You can safely ignore these requests and only process events with `x-amity-signature`.
    </Info>
    
    **Migration Approach**
    - Process events with `x-amity-signature` header
    - Ignore duplicate events with `x-eko-signature`
    - Update your systems to use the new signature format
  </Tab>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common Issues">
