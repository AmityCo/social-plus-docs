<Info>
  **UIKit Component**: Sharing components are built on top of the social.plus
  UIKit, providing ready-to-use sharing interfaces with customizable copy and
  native share sheet functionality across all supported content types.
</Info>

## Feature Overview

The Sharing UIKit components provide comprehensive tools for enabling content sharing throughout your application. Users can share posts, profiles, communities, and live streams through two primary methods: copying shareable links or using native platform share sheets. These components integrate seamlessly across multiple pages and content types.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Share Button Not Appearing" icon="eye-slash">
    **Problem**: Share buttons are not visible in expected locations
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify sharing functionality is enabled in your app configuration
    - Check that URL patterns are properly configured in the social.plus console
    - Ensure proper authentication and permissions for content access
    - Validate that the content exists and is accessible
    
    ```swift
    // Verify share configuration
    let config = AmityUIKitManager.getShareConfiguration()
    if config.isEnabled {
        // Sharing should be available
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Copy to Clipboard Failures" icon="clipboard-xmark">
    **Problem**: Copy to clipboard functionality not working
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check clipboard permissions on the platform
    - Verify that the generated link is valid
    - Ensure proper error handling for clipboard operations
    - Test on different devices and platforms
    
    ```typescript
    try {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(shareLink);
      // Show success feedback
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle clipboard permission or other errors
      console.error('Copy failed:', error);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Native Share Sheet Issues" icon="share-from-square">

<Tip>
  **Implementation Strategy**: Start by enabling sharing in high-engagement
  areas like post feeds and user profiles. Configure consistent branding and
  messaging across all sharing locations. Test both copy and native share
  functionality on all target platforms. Consider analytics tracking to
  understand which sharing methods users prefer and optimize accordingly.
