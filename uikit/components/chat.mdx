## Implementation Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chat Architecture Planning" icon="sitemap">
    **Designing your chat system structure**
    
    Plan your chat implementation based on your use case: start with basic conversations for simple messaging apps, add group features for collaboration platforms, or implement live chat for streaming applications. Consider user flows between different chat types and how users will discover and manage conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Platform Considerations" icon="devices">
    **Choosing the right components for your platforms**
    
    Flutter components provide the most comprehensive chat features, while iOS/Android/React live chat components are optimized for streaming use cases. Plan your cross-platform strategy based on feature requirements and choose components that align with your development approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scalability and Performance" icon="chart-line">
    **Building for growth and high usage**
    
    Chat components are built on the SDK foundation that handles caching, real-time updates, and performance optimization. Focus on UI/UX design, user flow optimization, and component configuration rather than low-level performance concerns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Experience Design" icon="user-check">

  <Accordion title="Safety and Moderation" icon="shield">
    **Implementing effective content management**
    
    Leverage built-in reporting mechanisms, configure appropriate moderation workflows, and provide clear user controls for blocking and muting. Plan role-based permissions for group chats and establish guidelines for live chat moderation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customization Strategy" icon="palette">
    **Aligning chat interfaces with your brand**
