## Search Management Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search Experience Design" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Creating intuitive search flows**
    
    Design clear entry points to search functionality from your chat interface. Consider placing search prominently in navigation, providing keyboard shortcuts for power users, and ensuring smooth transitions between search results and conversations.

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization" icon="bolt">
    **Handling large conversation volumes**
    
    The search component automatically handles performance optimization through server-side indexing and efficient result delivery. Real-time updates ensure users always see the most current results without manual refresh.
  </Accordion>
