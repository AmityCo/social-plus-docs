- Complete control over the development roadmap

## Decision Matrix

| Goal / Constraint | Dynamic UI | Component Styling | Fork & Extend |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Rebrand colors quickly | ✅ | ✅ | Overkill |
| Per-component styling | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (more cost) |
| New flow / navigation paradigm | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ |
| Replace data layer / inject custom services | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Deep performance tuning / virtualization changes | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Add brand-new primitive (e.g. Custom feed) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Minimal maintenance capacity | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Taxonomy: Elements → Components → Pages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="UI Elements (Atoms)">
    Primitive building blocks (buttons, text, avatar). Light logic. Style mostly via tokens; rarely stateful beyond hover / active / disabled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Components (Presentational vs Controller)">
    <strong>Presentational</strong>: Compose elements; focus on layout / visuals.
    <br/>
    <strong>Controller</strong>: Contain orchestration logic (e.g. data fetch, pagination). Examples: <code>FeedList</code>, <code>PostView</code>.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pages (Screens)">
    Route-level surfaces combining multiple controller/components with navigation context.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
