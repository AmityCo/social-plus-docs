The UIKit provides users with an overview of all their active chat channels. It offers a quick glance at the latest conversations and helps users easily stay on top of ongoing discussions.

**Key Features:**

* **Channel Preview**: Each chat entry displays the channel name, latest message, timestamp, and unread message count.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Channels are dynamically sorted based on the most recent activity, ensuring the most active conversations appear at the top.
* **Unread Indicators**: Channels with unread messages are visually highlighted, allowing users to identify new activity at a glance.
* **Swipe to Archive**: Users can swipe right on any chat entry to quickly archive a channel, helping keep their recent chats organized and clutter-free.
* **Tap to Enter**: Tapping on a channel navigates to the full chat conversation view, where users can read and send messages.

This page acts as the central hub for managing and navigating between conversations.
